<h2>GM-CSF censored data set in the cg package
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame used to illustrate the <span class="pkg">cg</span> package. It has a One Factor / One-Way /
Unpaired Samples layout. It also contains left-censored values of
varying degree in each of the six groups.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(gmcsfcens)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 8-by-6 data frame with up to 8 numeric observations per group from an experiment on the following 6
groups.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>PBS/Tg 197 </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>phosphate buffered saline control group</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>1mg/kg/Tg 197 </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>1 mg/kg dose</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>3mg/kg/Tg 197</code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>3 mg/kg dose</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>10/mg/kg/Tg 197 </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>10 mg/kg dose</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>30/mg/kg/Tg 197 </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>30 mg/kg dose</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>PBS/WT </code> </dt>
<dd>
<p>phosphate buffered saline control group of wild-type mice</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first five groups have transgenic (Tg197) mice subjects, a well
established model to induce arthritis. The sixth group are "wild-type"
mice that did not have
arthritis induced. The various doses of the inner four groups are
administrations of golimumab, a monoclonal antibody therapy.
</p>
<p>The individual group values are of mode character, since some of them
are represented as left-censored values such as <code>&lt;82.5</code>. Note
that two of the groups have less than 8 observations, and the
corresponding cells in the data frame actually contain empty quote <code>""</code> values.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>gmcsfcens</code> data set that comes with the <span class="pkg">cg</span> package
is in <code>groupcolumns</code> format. Each column represents a group, and
the observations in that group's column are the individual response
values. As described above, they are character valued potentially
left-censored representations.
</p>
<p>The 6 groups are regarded as levels of one factor in the
<code>prepareCGOneFactorData</code>, <code>fit</code>, and other methods in
the <span class="pkg">cg</span> package.
</p>
<p>Alternative formats of this data set is contained in
<code>gmcsfcens.listfmt</code>. See that help file for details,
including how such formats would be read and <code>prepare</code>d by <span class="pkg">cg</span>.
</p>
<p>GM-CSF stands for Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, a
type of cytokine that is important in the growth of white blood cells.
It is one of the outcomes measured in the experiment described in the
references section below. Therapeutic inhibition of it may be
beneficial in cases where too many white blood cells are produced,
such as arthritis. In other situations where white blood cell counts
are low, stimulation of it is desired. In the referenced study below, GM-CSF
is evaluated in the context of inflammation.
