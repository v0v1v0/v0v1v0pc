<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with responses to the 15 item Social Dominance Orientation inventory
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(sdo_cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with
2042 response profiles from Lucid, 1192 response profiles from MTurk,
and 1482 response profiles collected by YouGov in June 2018.  The sample from MTurk was a convenience sample
The respondents from YouGov were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education.
</p>
<p>See <code>Cat-class</code> for details regarding the Cat object structure.
See <code>grmCat</code> for details regarding the graded response model.
</p>
<p>A normal prior was chosen with mean from the theta estimates from the YouGov sample (.19) and a standard deviation (1)
wide enough to envelope the range of estimated theta values across both samples.
</p>
<p>Note that due to how the item parameters were estimated, large, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
</p>
<p>Response options are:
</p>
<p>5 = Strongly agree, 4 = Somewhat agree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 2 = Somewhat disagree, 1 = Strongly disagree
</p>
<p>The wording of the question items is:
