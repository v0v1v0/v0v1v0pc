<h2>Raster-based Hourly Fine Fuel Moisture Code</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>hffmcRaster</code> is used to calculate hourly Fine Fuel
Moisture Code (FFMC) based on hourly weather observations of screen level
(~1.4 m) temperature, relative humidity, 10 m wind speed, and 1-hour
rainfall. This implementation of the function includes an optional timestep
input which is defaulted to one hour, but can be reduced if sub-hourly
calculation of the code is needed.  The FFMC is in essence a bookkeeping
system for moisture content and thus it needs to use the last timestep's
value of FFMC in its calculation. <code>hffmcRaster</code> takes rasterized inputs
and generates raster maps as outputs.
</p>
<p>The hourly FFMC is very similar in its structure and calculation to the
Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System's daily FFMC (<code>fwi</code>)
but has an altered drying and wetting rate which more realistically reflects
the drying and wetting of a pine needle litter layer sitting on a decaying
organic layer.  This particular implementation of the Canadian Forest Fire
Danger Rating System's hourly FFMC provides for a flexible timestep; that
is, the data need not necessarily be in time increments of one hour.  This
flexibility has been added for some users who use this method with data
sampled more frequently that one hour.  We do not recommend using a timestep
much greater than one hour. An important and implicit assumption in this
calculation is that the input weather is constant over the timestep of each
calculation (e.g., typically over the previous hour).  This is a reasonable
assumption for an hour; however it can become problematic for longer
periods.  For brevity we have referred to this routine throughout this
description as the hourly FFMC.
</p>
<p>Because of the shortened timestep, which can lead to more frequent
calculations and conversion between moisture content and the code value
itself, we have increased the precision of one of the constants in the
simple formula that converts litter moisture content to the 'Code' value.
This is necessary to avoid a potential bias that gets introduced during
extremely dry conditions.  This is simply a change in the precision at which
this constant is used in the equation and is not a change to the standard
FFMC conversion between moisture and code value (which is referred to as the
FF-scale).
</p>
<p>The calculation requires the previous hour's FFMC as an input to the
calculation of the current hour's FFMC; this is because the routine can be
thought of as a bookkeeping system and needs to know the amount of moisture
being held in the fuel prior to any drying or wetting in the current period.
After each hour's calculation that newly calculated FFMC simply becomes the
starting FFMC in the next hour's calculation.  At the beginning of the
calculations at a station this previous hours FFMC must be estimated. It is
typical to use a value of 85 when this value cannot be estimated more
accurately; this code value corresponds to a moisture content of about 16%
in typical pine litter fuels.

but they are case insensitive. The order in which the input variables are
entered is not required.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ffmc_old</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single value of FFMC or a raster of FFMC for the previous
hour which will be used for the current hour's calculation. In some
situations, there are no previous-hourly FFMC values to calculate the
current hourly FFMC, the function will use a default value,
<code>ffmc_old=84</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time.step</code></td>
<td>
<p>timestep in hours. Default is 1 hour, set for standard
hourly FFMC calculation. While <code>time.step</code> is set to values with
decimal places, sub-hourly FFMC would be calculated.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hourlyFWI</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional for the computation of hourly ISI, FWI, and DSR.
Default is FALSE. While <code>hourlyFWI=TRUE</code>, daily BUI is required for the
computation of FWI.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>hffmcRaster</code> returns a vector of hourly or sub-hourly FFMC
values, which may contain 1 or multiple elements. Optionally when
<code>hourlyFWI=TRUE</code>, the function also output a data.frame contains input
weatherstream as well as the hourly or sub-hourly FFMC, ISI, FWI, and DSR.
