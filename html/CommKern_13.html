<h2>Simulated network edge weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Description of the simulated network edge weights function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_weights(network_df, wcr, bcr, bfcr = NA, fuzzy_comms = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>network_df</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing information about network nodes,
their community assignment, and all node dyads, coming from
<code>simnet_df_perturb</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wcr</code></td>
<td>
<p>within community edge weights, sampled from a beta distribution;
for example, c(8,8) will ask for the within community edge weights to be
sampled from a Beta(8,8) distribution</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bcr</code></td>
<td>
<p>between community edge weights, sampled from a beta distribution;
for example, c(1,8) will ask for the between community edge weights to be
sampled from a Beta(1,8) distribution</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bfcr</code></td>
<td>
<p>fuzzy community edge weights, sampled from a beta distribution;
for example, c(4,8) will ask for the fuzzy community edge weights to be
sampled from a Beta (4,8) distribution</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fuzzy_comms</code></td>
<td>
<p>the communities for which their distinction is 'fuzzy,' or
not as distinct; fuzzy communities tend to have higher between community edge
weights; for example, c('comm_a','comm_c') will create a fuzzy distinction
between communities a and c</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an ancillary function that creates a vector of edge weights sampled
from Beta distributions. Within and between community edge weights are each
sampled from a distinct Beta distribution. If 'fuzzy' communities wish to be
created, a third Beta distribution is specified and the communities for which
their distinction is 'fuzzy' also needs to be specified. This vector of edge
weights is then passed to <code>group_network_perturb</code> to create the
final simulated network object.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of edge weights associated with the node dyads from the
network data frame
