<h2>Graph visualization based on a specific centrality measure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function demonstrates the input graph in which the size of nodes
indicates calculated centrality value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">visualize_graph(
  x,
  computed_centrality_value = NULL,
  centrality.type = "Degree Centrality"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an igraph object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>computed_centrality_value</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the values of calculated centrality measure for each node.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>centrality.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of centrality which should be calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function represents the graph in which size of nodes are based on computed centrality value. If the values of wanted centrality
measure were computed then by placing them in computed_centrality_value argument to use it for drawing the plot. Otherwise, by only giving the
name of favorite centrality measure in centrality.type argument, this function will calculate it and  then demonstrates the corresponding graph.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A plot illustrating the input graph, where the size of nodes represents the calculated centrality values.
The function takes an igraph object as input and either a vector of precomputed centrality values or the name of the desired centrality measure.
If precomputed centrality values are provided in the computed_centrality_value argument, the graph will be plotted based on those values.
If only the name of the desired centrality measure is provided in the centrality.type argument, the function will calculate the centrality values
and then plot the graph.
The plot shows the nodes of the graph, with their sizes indicating the centrality values. The larger the node, the higher the centrality value.
This plot helps visualize the distribution of centrality values across the nodes of the graph.
The function returns the plot and does not modify the input graph.
