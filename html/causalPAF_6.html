<h2>Evaluates and Makes Formula for regression of exposure or risk factor or outcome on its parents in a causal Bayesian network directed acyclic graph.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Evaluates and Makes Formula for regression of exposure or risk factor or outcome on its parents in a causal Bayesian network directed acyclic graph. Given a causal Bayesian network, directed acyclic graph (DAG) where arrows representing
causal dependencies between confounders, risk factors,exposure and disease, together with a sensible probability distribution on
the graph that respects these causal dependencies. To consistently estimate causal effects that risk factors may have on each
other and on disease, we need to make a strong no unmeasured confounding assumption: that is common causes of nodes in the graph,
which may be causes of two risk factors or a cause of risk factor and disease, are also included as nodes in the graph.
Causal Bayesian networks have a local Markov property that the conditional probability distribution of any node <code class="reqn">X_j</code>, given values
for the other variables in the network, only depends on the values <code class="reqn"> x_{pa_{j}} </code> of the parent nodes.
