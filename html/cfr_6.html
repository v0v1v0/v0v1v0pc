<h2>Estimate a static disease severity measure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the severity of a disease, while optionally
correcting for reporting delays using an epidemiological delay distribution
of the time between symptom onset and death (onset-to-death).
</p>
<p>Other delay distributions may be passed to calculate different disease
severity measures such as the hospitalisation fatality risk.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cfr_static(data, delay_density = NULL, poisson_threshold = 100)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;data.frame&gt;⁠</code> containing the outbreak data. A daily time
series with dates or some other absolute indicator of time (e.g. epiday or
epiweek) and the numbers of new cases and new deaths at each time point.
Note that the required columns are "date" (for the date), "cases" (for the
number of reported cases), and "deaths" (for the number of reported deaths)
on each day of the outbreak.
</p>
<p>Note that the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;data.frame&gt;⁠</code> is required to have an unbroken sequence of
dates with no missing dates in between. The "date" column must be of class
<code>Date</code> (see <code>as.Date()</code>).
</p>
<p>Note also that the total number of cases must be greater than the total
number of reported deaths.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delay_density</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional argument that controls whether delay
correction is applied in the severity estimation.
May be <code>NULL</code>, for no delay correction, or a function that returns the
density function of a distribution to evaluate
density at user-specified values, e.g.
<code>function(x) stats::dgamma(x = x, shape = 5, scale = 1)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>poisson_threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>The case count above which to use Poisson
approximation. Set to 100 by default. Must be &gt; 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;data.frame&gt;⁠</code> with the maximum likelihood estimate and 95%
confidence interval of the severity estimates, named "severity_estimate",
"severity_low", and "severity_high".
</p>


<h3>Details: Adjusting for delays between two time series</h3>

<p>The method used in <code>cfr_static()</code> follows Nishiura et al.
(2009).
The function calculates a quantity <code class="reqn">u_t</code> for each day within the input
data, which represents the proportion of cases estimated to have
a known outcome on day <code class="reqn">t</code>.
Following Nishiura et al., <code class="reqn">u_t</code> is calculated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">u_t = \dfrac{\sum_{i = 0}^t
        \sum_{j = 0}^\infty c_i f_{j - i}}{\sum_{i = 0} c_i}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">f_t</code> is the value of the probability mass function at time <code class="reqn">t</code>
and <code class="reqn">c_t</code>, <code class="reqn">d_t</code> are the number of new cases and new deaths at time
<code class="reqn">t</code>, (respectively).
We then use <code class="reqn">u_t</code> at the end of the outbreak in the following likelihood
function to estimate the severity of the disease in question.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">{\sf L}({\theta \mid y}) = \log{\dbinom{u_tC}{D}} + D \log{\theta} +
  (u_tC - D)\log{(1.0 - \theta)}</code>
</p>

<p><code class="reqn">C</code> and <code class="reqn">D</code> are the cumulative number of cases and deaths
(respectively) up until time <code class="reqn">t</code>.
<code class="reqn">\theta</code> is the parameter we wish to estimate, the severity of the
disease. We estimate <code class="reqn">\theta</code> using simple maximum-likelihood methods,
allowing the functions within this package to be quick and easy tools to use.
</p>
<p>The precise severity measure — CFR, IFR, HFR, etc — that <code class="reqn">\theta</code>
represents depends upon the input data given by the user.
</p>
<p>The epidemiological delay-distribution density function passed to
<code>delay_density</code> is used to evaluate the probability mass function
parameterised by time; i.e. <code class="reqn">f(t)</code> which
gives the probability that a case has a known outcome (usually death) at time
<code class="reqn">t</code>, parameterised with disease-specific parameters before it is supplied
here.
</p>


<h4>Profile likelihood methods</h4>

<p>The naive CFR estimate (without delay correction) is the outcome of a
Binomial test on deaths and cases using <code>stats::binom.test()</code>.
The confidence intervals around the estimate are also taken from the test.
</p>
<p>The delay-corrected CFR estimates are however obtained by generating a
profile likelihood over the sequence <code>seq(1e-4, 1.0, 1e-4)</code>. The method used
depends on the outbreak size and the initial expectation of disease severity.
This is implemented in the internal function <code>.estimate_severity()</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Delay correction, small outbreaks</strong>: For outbreaks where the total cases
are below the user-specified 'Poisson threshold' (<code>poisson_threshold</code>,
default = 100), the CFR and uncertainty around it is taken from a profile
likelihood generated from a Binomial model of deaths (successes) and
estimated known outcomes (trials).
</p>

<ul><li> <p><strong>Delay correction, large outbreaks with low severity</strong>: For outbreaks
with total cases greater than the Poisson threshold (default = 100) and with
initial severity estimates &lt; 0.05, the CFR and uncertainty are taken from a
Poisson approximation of the Binomial profile likelihood (taking
<code class="reqn">\lambda = np</code> for <code class="reqn">n</code> estimated outcomes and <code class="reqn">p</code> as the severity
estimate).
</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Delay correction, large outbreaks with higher severity</strong>: For outbreaks
with total cases greater than the Poisson threshold (default = 100) and with
initial severity estimates <code class="reqn">\geq</code> 0.05, the CFR and uncertainty are taken
from a Normal approximation of the Binomial profile likelihood.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
