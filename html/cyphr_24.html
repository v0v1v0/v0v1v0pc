<h2>Register functions to work with encrypt/decrypt</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add information about argument rewriting so that they can be used
with encrypt and decrypt.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rewrite_register(package, name, arg, fn = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>package</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the package with the function to
support (as a scalar character).  If your function has no
package (e.g., a function you are working on outside of a
package, use "" as the name).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the function to support.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arg</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the argument in the target function that
refers to the file that should be encrypted or decrypted.  This
is the value you would pass through to <code>file_arg</code> in
encrypt.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fn</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional (and should be rare) argument used to work
around functions that pass all their arguments through to a
second function as dots.  This is how <code>read.csv</code> works.  If
needed this function is a length-2 character vector in the form
"package", "name" with the actual function that is used.  But
this should be very rare!</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If your package uses cyphr, it might be useful to add this as
an <code>.onLoad()</code> hook.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The saveRDS function is already supported.  But if we wanted to
# support it we could look at the arguments for the function:
args(saveRDS)
# The 'file' argument is the one that refers to the filename, so
# we'd write:
cyphr::rewrite_register("base", "saveRDS", "file")
# It's non-API but you can see what is supported in the package by
# looking at
ls(cyphr:::db)
</code></pre>
