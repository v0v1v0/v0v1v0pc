<h2>Chain Event Graph (ceg)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package has functionalities that allow us to create and learn
Chain Event Graph (CEG) models using a Bayesian framework. It provides us
with a Hierarchical Agglomerative algorithm to search the CEG model space.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package also includes several facilities for visualisations of the
objects associated with a CEG. The CEG class can represent a range of
relational data types, and supports arbitrary vertex, edge and graph
attributes. A Chain Event Graph is a tree-based graphical model that
provides a powerful graphical interface through which domain experts can
easily translate a process into sequences of observed events using plain
language. CEGs have been a useful class of graphical model especially to
capture context-specific conditional independences.
</p>
<p>Currently, ceg provides implementation to support the stratified family,
the user will use the following classes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Stratified.ceg.model
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Stratified.staged.tree
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Stratified.event.tree
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes are implemented as S4 classes and have constructor methods with
the same name as the class. A <code>plot</code> method is also provided.
