<h2>CPBayes: An R-package implemeting a Bayesian meta analysis method for studying cross-phenotype
genetic associations.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simultaneous analysis of genetic associations with multiple phenotypes may reveal shared
genetic susceptibility across traits (pleiotropy). CPBayes is a Bayesian meta analysis
method for studying cross-phenotype genetic associations. It uses summary-level data
across multiple phenotypes to simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level
pleiotropic association and estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the
risk locus. CPBayes is based on a spike and slab prior.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package consists of following functions:
<code>analytic_locFDR_BF_uncor</code>, <code>cpbayes_uncor</code>; <code>analytic_locFDR_BF_cor</code>, <code>cpbayes_cor</code>; <code>post_summaries</code>, <code>forest_cpbayes</code>, <code>estimate_corln</code>.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>analytic_locFDR_BF_uncor</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It analytically computes the local FDR (locFDR)
and Bayes factor (BF) quantifying the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association
for uncorrelated summary statistics.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cpbayes_uncor</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It implements CPBayes (based on MCMC) for uncorrelated summary statistics to
figure out the optimal subset of non-null traits underlying a pleiotropic signal and other insights.
The summary statistics across traits/studies are uncorrelated when the studies
have no overlapping/genetically related subjects.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>analytic_locFDR_BF_cor</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It analytically computes the local FDR (locFDR)
and Bayes factor (BF) for correlated summary statistics.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cpbayes_cor</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It implements CPBayes (based on MCMC) for correlated summary statistics to figure out
the optimal subset of non-null traits underlying a pleiotropic signal and other insights. The summary statistics across
traits/studies are correlated when the studies have overlapping/genetically related subjects
or the phenotypes were measured in a cohort study.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>post_summaries</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It summarizes the MCMC data produced by
<code>cpbayes_uncor</code> or <code>cpbayes_cor</code>.
It computes additional summaries to provide a better insight into a pleiotropic signal.
It works in the same way for both <code>cpbayes_uncor</code> and <code>cpbayes_cor</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>forest_cpbayes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It creates a forest plot presenting the pleiotropy result obtained by
<code>cpbayes_uncor</code> or <code>cpbayes_cor</code>. It works in the same way for
both <code>cpbayes_uncor</code> and <code>cpbayes_cor</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>estimate_corln</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It computes an approximate correlation matrix of
the beta-hat vector for multiple overlapping case-control studies using the
sample-overlap count matrices.</p>
</dd>
