<h2>BMI growth curves from age 2 to 25</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>By the courtesy of the Center of Disease Control (CDC), cNORM includes human growth data for children and adolescents
age 2 to 25 that can be used to model trajectories of the body mass index and to estimate percentiles for clinical
definitions of under- and overweight. The data stems from the NHANES surveys in the US and was published in 2012
as public domain. The data was cleaned by removing missing values and it includes the following variables from or
based on the original dataset.
