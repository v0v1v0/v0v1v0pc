<h2>Narcissistic Personality Cat Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for latent trait model fit with responses
to the  40 item Narcissistic Personality inventory
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(npi_cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Cat</code> of length 1.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for latent trait model fit with
2945 response profiles collected by Qualtrics in June 2018
and 10440 response profiles collected by the Open Source Psychometrics Project in 2012.
</p>
<p>See <code>Cat-class</code> for details regarding the Cat object structure.
See <code>ltmCat</code> for details regarding the latent trait model.
</p>
<p>A normal prior was chosen with mean from the theta estimates from the Qualtrics sample (-.069) and a standard deviation (1)
wide enough to envelope the range of estimated theta values across both samples.
</p>
<p>Note that due to how the item parameters were estimated, large, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
</p>
<p>Item responses are paired. Respondents had to choose the one that fit them the best.
</p>
<p>The wording of the item responses is:

<p>*Note that Item 1 is "reverse coded" from the coding that is typically used.
This is because item parameter estimation constrains the first item's discrimination parameter
to be positive.  So the reverse coding was done for the more intuitive
interpretation of item parameters and theta
estimates as larger, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
