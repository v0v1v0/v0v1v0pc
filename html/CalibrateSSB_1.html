<h2>Weighting and Estimation for Panel Data with Non-Response</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>CalibrateSSB is an R-package that handles repeated surveys with partially
overlapping samples. Initially the samples are weighted by linear
calibration using known or estimated population totals. A robust model based
covariance matrix for all relevant estimated totals is calculated from the
residuals according to the calibration model. Alternatively a design based
covariance matrix is calculated in a very similar way. A cluster robust
version is also possible. In the case of estimated populations totals the
covariance matrix is adjusted by utilizing the theory of Särndal and
Lundström (2005). Variances of linear combinations (changes and averages)
and ratios are calculated from this covariance matrix. The linear
combinations and ratios can involve variables within and/or between sample
waves. <br></p>
