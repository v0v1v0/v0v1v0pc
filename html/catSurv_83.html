<h2>Machiavellianism Personality Cat Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with responses to the 20 item machiavellianism inventory
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(mach_cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Cat</code> of length 1.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with
3020 response profiles collected by Qualtrics in June 2018
and 12299 response profiles collected by the Open Source Psychometrics Project in 2012.
</p>
<p>See <code>Cat-class</code> for details regarding the Cat object structure.
See <code>grmCat</code> for details regarding the graded response model.
</p>
<p>A normal prior was chosen with mean from the theta estimates from the Qualtrics sample (-0.713) and a standard deviation (1)
wide enough to envelope the range of estimated theta values across both samples.
</p>
<p>Note that due to how the item parameters were estimated, large, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
</p>
<p>Response options are:
5 = Strongly agree, 4 = Somewhat agree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 2 = Somewhat disagree, 1 = Strongly disagree
</p>
<p>The wording of the item responses is:
