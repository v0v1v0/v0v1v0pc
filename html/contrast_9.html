<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Complete Two-Factor Experiment
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A gene expression experiment was run to assess the effect of a compound
under two different diets: high fat and low fat. The main comparisons of
interest are the difference between the treated and untreated groups within
a diet. The interaction effect was a secondary hypothesis. For illustration,
we only include the expression value of one of the genes. The study design
was a full two-way factorial with <code>n = 24</code> samples.
