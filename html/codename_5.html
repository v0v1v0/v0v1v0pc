<h2>Generate a unique codename for yourself, your organization, other people, your projects, and whatever else</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>codename()</code> is a tool for generating codenames for various things.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">codename(type = "any", seed)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>a type of code the user wants. Defaults to "any", but "gods", "nicka", "ubuntu", and "wu-tang" are available.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional reproducible seed, which can be specified as a character or number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When type is 'any' (the default), the function combines all adjective data
frames together (i.e. those from the Wu-Tang set, the colors, and the generic
adjectives) and combines all noun data frames together (i.e. the animals, the
generic nouns, the gods, and the Wu-Tang nouns). It then samples from each and
combines them together.
</p>
<p>When type is 'gods', the function randomly samples a god from the <code>gods</code>
data frame and pastes it to a random color or generic adjective.
</p>
<p>When type is 'ubuntu', a codename is derived that is broadly consistent with
how Ubuntu versions their releases. This particular way of doing it starts with
sampling an animal from the <code>animals</code> data frame. After an animal is
selected, the function finds the first letter of the animal and matches it
with something from the <code>adjectives</code> or <code>xkcd_colors</code> data sets.
However, anything on the adjective side of the equation must be of length one.
In other words, you can get "yellow yak" but you cannot have "yellow orange
yak" because the "yellow orange" color is a two-word modifier.
</p>
<p>When type is 'wu-tang', a name is derived by randomly sampling from the
<code>wu_adjs</code> and <code>wu_nouns</code> data frames.
</p>
<p>When type is 'nicka', the function randomly samples a U.S. agency from the
<code>nicka_blocks</code> data frame. This agency has a series of two-character blocks
from which they can draw a noun and an adjective. Thereafter, the function
randomly selects something from a compilation of the adjectives and the nouns
that start with something from the two-character block that was selected,
though the sampling procedure omits any adjective or noun that is more than
one word. You can cross-reference your code name to the <code>nicka_blocks</code>
data frame to see what agency you're representing for something that I'm sure
is nefarious and may require a congressional hearing.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>codename()</code> takes a preferred type of code and an optional reproducible seed and returns
a codename for the user to consider for whatever it is they want.
