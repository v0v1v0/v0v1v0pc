<h2>Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Description of the adjusted Rand Index function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">adj_RI(a, b)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of classifications; this must be a vector of characters,
integers, numerics, or a factor, but not a list.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of classifications</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In information theory, the Rand Index (also called the Rand Measure) is a
measure of the similarity between two data clusterings or classifications. If
N is the set of elements and X and Y are the partition of N into n subsets,
then the Rand Index is composed of four subsets: (a) the number of pairs of
elements in N that are in the same subset in in X and the same subset in Y;
(b) the number of pairs of elements in N that are in different subsets in X
and different subsets in Y; (c) the number of pairs of elements in N that
are in the same subset in X but different subsets in Y; and (d) the number of
pairs of elements in N that are in different subsets in X but the same subset
in Y. The adjusted Rand Index is the corrected-for-chance version of the Rand
Index, which establishes a baseline by using the expected similarity of all
pairwise comparisons between clusterings specified by a random model. The ARI
can yield negative results if the index is less than the expected index.
