<h2>Simple partial sorting of a vector of elements.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sort the elements in a vector according to a set of precedence
rules.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spsort(x,L=NULL)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data frame with at least two columns. The first two 
columns are interpreted as precedence pairs, meaning that the element in
column 1 should appear before the one in column 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of elements to be sorted. If NULL, it becomes all of the
unique elements in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x[1:2,]⁠</span>’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠spsort⁠</span>’ steps through rows of ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ identifying the positions of the 
leading and trailing elements in each rule. If the leading element in the rule
does not precede the trailing element in L, its position in L is moved to just
ahead of the trailing element. If all of the possible precedence rules for the
vector L are specified, the sorting will be unique. In most cases, the order
of the result will depend upon the initial order of L and the order of the
precendence rules.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The vector ‘<span class="samp">⁠L⁠</span>’ sorted by the rules in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’.</p>
