<p>These outcomes are based on a harmonized set of data from three
clinical trials. The harmonized data from these trials are contained in
the packages <code>ctn0094data</code> and <code>ctn0094DataExtra</code>. These outcomes are
calculated in the three abstinence, relapse, and reduction "library"
vignettes of this package. The data dictionary is currently stored as an
Excel spreadsheet in <code>inst/suppl_docs/definitions_20220405.xlsx</code>.
