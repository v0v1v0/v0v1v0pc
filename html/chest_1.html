<h2>Change-in-Estimate Approach to Assess Confounding Effects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In clinical trials and epidemiological studies, the association
between an exposure and the outcome of interest in a study can be estimated by
<em>regression coefficients</em>, <em>odds ratios</em> or <em>hazard ratios</em> depending
on the nature of study designs and outcome measurements. We use a general term
<em>effect estimate</em> here for any of those measurements in this document.
Based on those measurements,
we determine if a treatment is effective (or detrimental) or a factor is a risk factor.
Imbalanced distributions of other factors could bias the effect estimates, called
<em>confounding</em>. One way to assess the
confounding effect of a factor is to examine the difference in effect
estimates between models with and without a specific factor. <code>'chest'</code> allows
users quickly calculate the changes when potential confounding factors
are sequentially added to the model in a stepwise fashion. At each step, one
variable which creates the largest change (%) of the effect estimate among the remaining
variables is added to the model. <code>'chest'</code> returns a graph and a data frame (table) with
effect estimates (95% CI) and change (%) values. The package currently has the following main
functions: <code>'chest_lm'</code> for linear regression, <code>'chest_glm'</code> for logistic
regression and Poisson regression, <code>'chest_clogit'</code> for matched logistic
regression, <code>'chest_nb'</code> for negative binomial regression and <code>'chest_cox'</code> for
Cox proportional hazards models.
