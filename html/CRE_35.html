<h2>Set Logger settings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Updates logger settings, including log level and location of the file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set_logger(logger_file_path = "CRE.log", logger_level = "INFO")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>logger_file_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A path (including file name) to log the messages.
(Default: CRE.log)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>logger_level</code></td>
<td>
<p>The log level. When a log level is set, all log levels
below it are also activated (if implemented). Available levels include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> TRACE: Provides verbose detailed logging, including the steps taken to
achieve a result, often used for debugging. Activating TRACE will also
enable DEBUG, INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> DEBUG: Provides detailed logging about the flow of the application, used
mostly by developers to understand potential issues. Activating DEBUG will
also enable INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> INFO (Default): Standard messages that inform the user about the normal
operation of the system. Activating INFO will also enable SUCCESS, WARN,
ERROR, and FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SUCCESS: Messages indicating successful completion of a particular
operation or task. Activating SUCCESS will also enable WARN, ERROR, and
FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> WARN: Warning messages about events that might cause problems in the
future, but are not yet errors. Activating WARN will also enable ERROR
and FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ERROR: Reports an error due to which the system may not be able to
achieve its functionality, but the application won't halt. Activating
ERROR will also enable FATAL logs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> FATAL: Reports very severe error events that will presumably lead the
application to abort.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value. This function is called for side effects.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Log levels are specified by developers during the initial implementation.
Future developers or contributors can leverage these log levels to better
capture and document the application's processes and events.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
set_logger("Debug")
