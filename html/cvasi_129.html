<h2>Set time-dependent parameters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parameters which change their value over time are referred to as <em>forcings</em>.
If and what parameters can vary over time depends on the model in question.
In many cases, <em>forcings</em> represent time-series of environmental properties.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set_forcings(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'EffectScenario'
set_forcings(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'list'
set_forcings(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>(vector of) scenario objects</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>named argument list to set as forcings</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Forcing time-series are always represented by a
<code>data.frame</code> containing two columns. The first column representing time,
the second representing the parameter that is a function of time. The
ordering of columns is mandatory. The column names are essentially irrelevant
but may help documenting the scenario and its data. The rows must be
ordered chronologically. A time-series can consist of only a single row; in
this case it will represent constant conditions.
</p>
<p>Handling forcing time-series is a costly task for the ODE solver due to consistency
checks and interpolation between timesteps. How the solver interpolates
the forcing time-series can be controlled by certain arguments to functions
such as <code>simulate()</code> and <code>effect()</code>. Please refer to <code>simulate()</code> for a brief
overview and deSolve::forcings for a detailed description.
</p>
<p>Forcing time-series should be kept as short as possible and as complex as
needed for optimal computational efficiency.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># constant values will be automatically converted to a data.frame
Lemna_Schmitt() %&gt;% set_forcings(temp=20) -&gt; lemna
lemna@forcings

# setting multiple forcings at once
df &lt;- data.frame(t=0:14, temp=rnorm(15, mean=20)) # random temperature series
Lemna_Schmitt() %&gt;% set_forcings(temp=df, rad=15000) -&gt; lemna
lemna@forcings

# forcings can also be supplied as a named list
Lemna_Schmitt() %&gt;% set_forcings(list(temp=20, rad=15000)) -&gt; lemna
lemna@forcings
</code></pre>
