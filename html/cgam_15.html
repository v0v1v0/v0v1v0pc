<h2>Alachua County Study of Mental Impairment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The date set is from a study of mental health for a random sample of 40 adult residents of Alachua County, Florida. Mental impairment is an ordinal response with 4 categories: well, mild symptom formation, moderate symptom formation, and impaired, which are recorded as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Life event index is a composite measure of the number and severity of important life events that occurred with the past three years, e.g., birth of a child, new job, divorce, or death of a family member. It is an integer from 0 to 9. Another covariate is socio-economic status and it is measured as binary: high = 1, low = 0.
