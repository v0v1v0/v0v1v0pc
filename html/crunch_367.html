<h2>Collapse an array from a CrunchCube by summing across dimensions to remove</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Typically when collapsing a crosstab you can just sum across the dimensions
that you want to collapse across. However, because we have array-type
questions/dimensions we have to be a little bit smarter. We cannot sum across
any subvariable dimension (dimension types ending with "_items") because that
would inflate the number of respondents by approximately the number of
subvariables. Instead, we take the mean across any "_items" dimension. In
principle, we could just take a single item or <code>unique</code> across the "_items"
dimensions, however due to floating point differences + rounding there are
minute differences that pop up, <code>mean</code> smooths over those tiny differences.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dimSums(x, margin = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the CrunchCube to collapse</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>margin</code></td>
<td>
<p>the margins that should be summed within (in other words: the
dimension that will be retained)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>dimSums</code> returns a cube that retains the dimensions given in <code>margin</code> and
collapses all the others. This is useful if you want to get counts that are
equivalent to a univariate cube from a multivariate cube. For example
<code>dimSums(crtabs(~ fruit + pets, ds), 1)</code> will be equal to <code>crtabs(~ fruit, ds)</code> and <code>dimSums(crtabs(~ fruit + pets, ds), 2)</code> will be equal to <code>crtabs(~ pets, ds)</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a duly-collapsed CrunchCube
