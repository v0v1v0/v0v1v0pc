<h2>Curve Linear Regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>clr</code> provides functions for curve linear regression via dimension
reduction.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package implements a new methodology for linear regression with both
curve response and curve regressors, which is described in Cho et al. (2013)
and Cho et al. (2015).
The CLR model performs a data-driven dimension reduction, based on a
singular value decomposition in a Hilbert Space, as well as a data
transformation so that the relationship between the transformed data is
linear and can be captured by simple regression models.
