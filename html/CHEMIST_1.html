<h2>Causal Inference with High-Dimensional Error-Prone Covariates and
Misclassified Treatments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package CHEMIST, referred to Causal inference with High-dimsensional Error-
prone Covariates and MISclassified Treatments, aims to deal with the average
treatment effect (ATE), where the data are subject to high-dimensionality and
measurement error. This package primarily contains two functions: one is
Data_Gen that is applied to generate artificial data, including potential
outcomes, error-prone treatments and covariates, and the other is FATE that is
used to estimate ATE with measurement error correction.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CHEMIST_package()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package aims to estimate ATE in the presence of high-dimensional and
error-prone data. The strategy is to do variable selection by feature screening
and general outcome-adaptive lasso. After that, measurement error in
covariates are corrected. Finally, with informative and error corrected data
obtained, the propensity score can be estimated and can be used to estimate
ATE by the inverse probability weight approach.
