<h2>Humor Styles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset was collected with an interactive online version of the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) which assesses four independent ways in which people express and appreciate humor (Martin et al. 2003): affiliative (items with prefix AF), defined as the benign uses of humor to enhance one's relationships with others; self-enhancing (SE), indicating uses of humor to enhance the self; aggressive (AG), the use of humor to enhance the self at the expense of others; self-defeating (SD), the use of humor to enhance relationships at the expense of oneself. The main part of the questionnaire consisted of 32 statements rated from 1 to 5 according to the respondents' level of agreement. The number of respondents is 993.</p>
