<h2>Merge two CFtime objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two <code>CFtime</code> instances can be merged into one with this operator, provided
that the units and calendars of the datums of the two instances are
equivalent.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'CFtime,CFtime'
e1 + e2
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e1, e2</code></td>
<td>
<p>CFtime. Instances of the <code>CFtime</code> class.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the origins of the two datums are not identical, the earlier origin is
preserved and the offsets of the later origin are updated in the resulting
CFtime instance.
</p>
<p>The order of the two parameters is indirectly significant. The resulting
<code>CFtime</code> instance will have the offsets of both instances in the order that
they are specified. There is no reordering or removal of duplicates. This is
because the time series are usually associated with a data set and the
correspondence between the data in the files and the CFtime instance is thus
preserved. When merging the data sets described by this time series, the
order must be identical to the merging here.
</p>
<p>Any bounds that were set will be removed. Use <code>bounds()</code> to retrieve
the bounds of the individual <code>CFtime</code> instances and then set them again after
merging the two instances.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>CFtime</code> object with a set of offsets composed of the offsets of
the instances of <code>CFtime</code> that the operator operates on. If the datum units
or calendars of the <code>CFtime</code> instances are not equivalent, an error is
thrown.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e1 &lt;- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "gregorian", 0:364)
e2 &lt;- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01 00:00:00", "standard", 365:729)
e1 + e2
</code></pre>
