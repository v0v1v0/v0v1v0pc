<h2>Angle between Two Steps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the angle between two steps in the dataset that occur at the same timepoint.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">angleSteps(X, trackids, t, degrees = TRUE, quietly = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>a tracks object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trackids</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of two indices specifying the tracks to get steps from, or
a dataframe/matrix of two columns (where every row contains a pair of trackids to compute 
a step angle for)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>the timepoint at which the steps should start, or a vector of timepoints if trackids
is a matrix with multiple step pairs to compute angles for.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degrees</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; should angle be returned in degrees instead of radians? (defaults to <code>TRUE</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quietly</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; should a warning be returned if one or both of the steps are missing
in the data and the function returns NA?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single angle, or NA if the desired step is missing for one or both
of the tracks. If trackids is a matrix with multiple step pairs to compute angles for,
the output is a numeric vector of angles (or NA values).
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Find the angle between the steps of the tracks with ids 1 and 2, at the 3rd
## timepoint in the dataset.
t &lt;- timePoints( TCells )[3]
angleSteps( TCells, c("1","3"), t )

## Do this for multiple pairs and times at once: between cells 1 and 3 at the
## 3rd timepoint, and between 1 and 4 at the fourth timepoint.
pairs &lt;- data.frame( cell1 = c("1","1"), cell2 = c("3","4"))
times &lt;- timePoints(TCells)[3:4]
angleSteps( TCells, pairs, times )
</code></pre>
