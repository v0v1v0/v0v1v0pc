Bluenose-East Caribou Herd 2000 Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Population size of the Bluenose-East caribou herd (Northwest Territories, Canada) 
from a postcalving survey in June-July 2000.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(BEH00)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>16 by 2 numeric matrix, with the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>xi</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>number of radio-collared animals in the detected (photographed) groups</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gni</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>size of the detected groups</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>During this survey, 33 collars were active (Patterson et al. also made calculation considering that
30 collars were active because 3 caribou were never located after collaring).<br>
23 collars (70%) were photographed among the 16 detected groups.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This data set excludes the six groups without radio-collared animal from Table 1 of Patterson et al. 
(2004) since they cannot be included in the estimates of the total population size.<br></p>
<p>For the last three groups, the size <code>gni</code> has been modified according to what Patterson et al. 
(2004) did (38% of what appears in Table 1).
