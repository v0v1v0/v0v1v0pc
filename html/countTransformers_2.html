Calculate Jaccard Index for Two Binary Vectors
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate Jaccard index for two binary vectors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getJaccard(cl1, cl2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cl1</code></td>
<td>

<p>n by 1 binary vector of classification 1 for the n subjects
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cl2</code></td>
<td>

<p>n by 1 binary vector of classification 2 for the n subjects
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Jaccard Index is defined as the ratio </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">d/(b+c+d</code>
</p>
<p>, where
<code class="reqn">d</code> is the number of subjects who were classified to group 1 by both classification rules,
<code class="reqn">b</code> is the number of subjects who were classified to group 1 by classification rule 1 and were classified to group 0 by classification rule 2,
<code class="reqn">c</code> is the number of subjects who were classified to group 0 by classification rule 1 and were classified to group 1 by classification rule 2.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  n = 10
  set.seed(1234567)

  # generate two random binary vector of size n
  cl1 = sample(c(1,0), size = n, prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE)
  cl2 = sample(c(1,0), size = n, prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE)
  cat("\n2x2 contingency table &gt;&gt;\n")
  print(table(cl1, cl2))

  JI = getJaccard(cl1, cl2)
  cat("Jaccard index = ", JI, "\n")
