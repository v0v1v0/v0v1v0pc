<h2>Aggregate co-occurrence matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to aggregate those co-occurrence matrices to form
an overall(pooled) co-occurrence matrix.The users can get two kinds of
aggregated (i.e. pooled) co-occurrence matrices: the non-weighted aggregated
co-occurrence matrix, and the weighted aggregated co-occurrence matrix.
And the users can make their choices through the setting of corresponding
parameters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coefa_acm(x,sz,samplesized =c(TRUE,FALSE),raw=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing multiple co-occurrence matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing multiple sample sized of original study.
The elements of the vector should be in the same order as the original study,
that is, the first element is the sample size of the first original study,
and the second element is the sample size of the second original study....</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>samplesized</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value is used to select the weighting method.
If "samplesized"=TRUE, the final aggregated co-occurrence matrix will be
obtained by weighting the sample size. If "samplesized"=FALSE, the size of
the sample size is not considered in the process of summarizing the
co-occurrence matrix, that is, the co-occurrence matrix is added and divided
by the number of matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>raw</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value.If raw=TRUE,Raw co-occurrence matrix and similarity
matrix will be obtained. If raw=FALSE(The default value is FALSE),only similarity
matrix will be obtained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix formed by adding all the co-occurrence matrices,or adding
them after weighting by sample size.
