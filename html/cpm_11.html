<h2>Detects Multiple Change Points in a Sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to detect a multiple change points in a sequence of observations using the Change Point Model (CPM) framework for sequential (Phase II) change detection. The observations are processed in order, starting with the first, and a decision is made after each observation whether a change point has occurred. A full description of the CPM framework can be found in the papers cited in the reference section.
</p>
<p>Unlike the <code>detectChange</code> function, <code>processStream</code> does not terminate and return when a change point is encountered. Instead, a new CPM is initialised immediately following the change point, with all previous observations being discarded. The monitoring then continues, starting from the first observation after the change point. If more change points are discovered later in the sequence, the CPM is again reinitialised after each one. In this way, the whole sequence of observations will be processed and multiple change points may be detected.        
</p>
<p>For a fuller overview of this function including a description of the CPM framework and examples of how to use the various functions, please consult the package manual "Parametric and Nonparametric Sequential Change Detection in R: The cpm Package" available from www.gordonjross.co.uk

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Mann-Whitney</code>: Mann-Whitney test statistic, as in [Ross et al, 2011]. Use to detect location shifts in a stream with a (possibly unknown) non-Gaussian distribution.

</p>
</li>
</ul>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ARL0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Determines the <code class="reqn">ARL_0</code> which the CPM should have, which corresponds to the average number of observations before a false positive occurs, assuming that the sequence does not undergo a chang. Because the thresholds of the CPM are computationally expensive to estimate, the package contains pre-computed values of the thresholds corresponding to several common values of the <code class="reqn">ARL_0</code>. This means that only certain  values for the <code class="reqn">ARL_0</code> are allowed. Specifically, the <code class="reqn">ARL_0</code> must have one of the following values: 370, 500, 600, 700, ..., 1000, 2000, 3000, ..., 10000, 20000, ..., 50000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>startup</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of observations after which monitoring begins. No change points will be flagged during this startup period. This should be set to at least 20.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>
<p>A smoothing parameter which is used to reduce the discreteness of the test statistic when using the FET CPM. See [Ross and Adams, 2012b] in the References section for more details on how this parameter is used.  Currently the package only contains sequences of ARL0 thresholds corresponding to lambda=0.1 and lambda=0.3, so using other values will result in an error. If no value is specified, the default value will be 0.1.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The sequence of observations which was processed.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>detectionTimes</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the points in the sequence at which changes were detected, defined as the first observation after which <code class="reqn">D_t</code> exceeded the test threshold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>changePoints</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the best estimates of the change point locations, for each detecting change point. If a change is detected after the <code class="reqn">t^{th}</code> observation, then the change estimate is the value of <code class="reqn">k</code> which maximises <code class="reqn">D_{k,t}</code>.</p>
