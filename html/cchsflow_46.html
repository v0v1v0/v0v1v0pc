<h2>Food insecurity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not a function.
</p>
<p>This is a derived variable that uses the different food insecurity
variables from all CCHS cycles to generate food_insecurity_der that is
harmonized across all cycles. food_insecurity_der is a categorical variable
with two categories:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> no food insecurity in the last 12 months 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> food insecurity in the last 12 months
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">food_insecurity_der(FINF1, FSCDHFS, FSCDHFS2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FINF1</code></td>
<td>
<p>variable used in 2001 and 2003 survey cycles indicating food
insecurity in the past 12 months</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FSCDHFS</code></td>
<td>
<p>variable used in the 2005 survey cycle measuring food
insecurity &amp; hunger in the last 12 months</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FSCDHFS2</code></td>
<td>
<p>variable used in 2007-2014 survey cycles measuring household
food insecurity in the last 12 months</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Food insecurity is measured differently across CCHS cycles. In 2001
and 2003, FINF1 is used; in 2005, FSCDHFS is used; and in 2007
to 2014, FSCDHFS2 is used. Each variable examines food insecurity in the
household over the past 12 months, but use different base variables to
derive food insecurity.  
</p>
<p>If you are using cchsflow for CCHS survey years that use consistent food
insecurity variables, it is appropriate to use FINF1, FSCDHFS, or FSCDHFS2
that are available on cchsflow. If you are using cchsflow for only the 2001
and 2003 cycles, it is appropriate to use FINF1. If you are using cchsflow
for only the 2005 cycle, FSCDHFS is appropriate. If you are using cchsflow
for cycles between 2007 and 2014, FSCDHFS2 is appropriate. For multiple CCHS
survey years that do not use the same food insecurity variables (i.e. using
cchsflow for years 2001 to 2007), food_insecurity_der is recommended.
