<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://ippsr.msu.edu/survey-research/state-state-survey-soss">State of the State Survey</a> (SOSS) is
regularly collected by the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR) at Michigan State
University (MSU). Each wave is collected from a sample of 1000 adults in the US state of Michigan, and
includes sampling weights to obtain a sample that is representative of the state's population with respect
to age, gender, race, and education. The <code>soss()</code> function reads the raw data from IPPSR's website, extracts
and recodes selected variables useful for studying childfree adults and other family statuses, then returns
either an unweighted data frame, or a weighted design object that can be analyzed using the <code>survey</code>
package. Questions necessary for identifying childfree adults have been asked in five waves, which each
include unique questions that may be of interest:

<p><strong>Notes</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Wave 79 did not include a "do not know" option for selected questions. Therefore, it is not possible to identify
"undecided" or "ambivalent non-parent" respondents. This may lead other family status categories to be inflated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Wave 82 originally included a 500 person oversample of parents, but they are excluded from <code>nsfg(wave==82)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The provided sampling weights are designed to be used in the analyses of individual waves. Combining data from multiple
waves may require using adjusted weights.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame or weighted svydesign object containing variables described in the codebook available using <code>vignette("codebooks")</code>.
If you are offline, or if the requested data are otherwise unavailable, NULL is returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
unweighted &lt;- soss(waves = 86)  #Request unweighted data
if (!is.null(unweighted)) {  #If data was available...
table(unweighted$famstat) / nrow(unweighted)  #Fraction of respondents with each family status
}

weighted &lt;- soss(waves = 86, survey = TRUE)  #Request weighted data
if (!is.null(weighted)) {  #If data was available...
survey::svymean(~famstat, weighted, na.rm = TRUE)  #Estimated prevalence of each family status
}
