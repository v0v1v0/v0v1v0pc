<h2>Gene Expression Dataset - Cervical Cancer (expression values)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example dataset is taken from the below referenced study.  That study was aimed 
at identification of gene expression profiles in cervical cancer and the role of specific genes
in cervical carcinogenesis.  
</p>
<p>This dataset was prepared for visualization by retrieving the gene expression values that follow the source 
data header information and moving the ID column to the rownames.  This allows the storage and processing of the 
large numeric data as a matrix instead of a data frame for efficiency while retaining the ability to join it to
the sample annotations and gene information.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GSE9750_expression
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A numeric matrix containing gene expression data
</p>
