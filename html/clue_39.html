<h2>Gordon-Vichi Macroeconomic Partition Ensemble Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Soft partitions of 21 countries based on macroeconomic data for the
years 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("GVME")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named cluster ensemble of 5 soft partitions of 21 countries into 2
or 3 classes.  The names are the years to which the partitions
correspond.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The partitions were obtained using fuzzy <code class="reqn">c</code>-means on measurements
of the following variables: the annual per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) in USD (converted to 1987 prices); the percentage of GDP
provided by agriculture; the percentage of employees who worked in
