together with covariates, of 8th graders in 1988.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("NELS88")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>data.frame</code> containing the identification
number of the school to which the student belongs (<code>ID</code>),
the standardized score of the student on a
mathematics achievement test (<code>Math</code>; rescaled by an Item
Response Theory (IRT) method where a higher score indicates greater
proficiency in mathematics), the standardized
score of the student on a science achievement test (<code>Science</code>),
the standardized score of the student on a reading achievement test
(<code>Reading</code>), a factor indicating whether the student is a member
of an ethnic minority group (<code>Minority</code>), a numeric measure of
the socio-economic status of the student and family (<code>SES</code>), a
factor indicating whether the student is female (<code>Female</code>), a
