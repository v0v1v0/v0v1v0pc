<h2>Identify Most Suitable Methods for Conservation Prioritization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifies suitable methods for conservation prioritization based on a user dialogue on conservation targets and data availability.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">find_method(ranking = "both", weights = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ranking</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string. The methods used for ranking the methods. See details. One of "both", "strict", "inclusive". Default = "both".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>named list. Provide numeric values to weight questions differently. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Based on the <code>ranking</code> argument, the conservation prioritization methods in the database are
ranked according to the user-provided information. If ranking = "strict" methods receive
one point for each full agreement with user reply (yes and no), if ranking = "inclusive",
methods get one point when they include a feature confirmed by the user (but non for not including it).
This means that ranking = "inclusive" will  likely return more general methods
that can include many different types of data and perspectives. If ranking = "both",
methods are first ranked as in strict and then equal ranks split by the inclusive ranking.
</p>
<p>The <code>weight</code> argument allows to change the weighting of individual questions relative to the others.
The names of the list follow <code>names(traits)</code>, from “scale” (for question 1) to
“includes_simulation” (for question 17). The weights may include any numbers of questions.
See examples
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data.frame containing potentially suitable spatial conservation prioritization
methods order by goodness of fit according to the user-selected algorithm (best fit on top).
Furthermore prints the three most suitable methods to screen.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
find_method()
#double weight to question 3 and 15
find_method(weights = list(phylogeny = 2, vulnerability = 2))

## End(Not run)
