<h2>
Execute simple zero-argument functions

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Execute simple zero-argument functions without having to type the "()" , and without having to go through the bother of <code>makeActiveBinding</code>. 
This code is provided primarily to allow the user to build his own set of command "shortcuts" by modifying the set of arguments to the <code>switch</code> function in the function body.  The bulk of the code is copied from the excellent package <code>sos</code> .
The name <code>splatnd</code> cannot be called directly, and doesn't even exist after being sourced.  It serves to define a variety of operators <code>![your_string_here]</code> .  If the string after <code>!</code> is not in the switch-list, the function defaults to the normal splat operator, i.e. NOT[your_string_here] .
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>none

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The strings supported, with their associated functions,  as delivered are:
'newdev' = dev.new(width=4.5, height= 4.5, restoreConsole=T),
'qapla' = cat('batlh tIn chav'),
'quitn' = quit('no'),
'quity' = quit('yes'),
There's an obvious risk of undesired results should there exist an object in the environment with the same name as one of the items in the <code>switch</code> options.  The workaround is to enclose the object name in parentheses.  See the example. 

</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The returned value is the result of whatever function or operator was invoked.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>


<p>The bulk of the code is taken directly from the <code>sos</code> package.
