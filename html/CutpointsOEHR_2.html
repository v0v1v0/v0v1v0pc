<h2>A simulation data to test cutpointsOEHR</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataframe named 'test'contains simulated (t,d,x,x1). The relationship of log relative hazard and x is set to to quandratic, which results in a U-shaped relationship.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">test
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a dataframe contains 200 rows and 4 variables. The 4 varibles are
</p>

<dl>
<dt>t</dt>
<dd>
<p>simulated times of developing survival outcomes like deathes, relapes, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d</dt>
<dd>
<p>censoring indicator, 1 means that survival outcomes are not observed, 0 means survival outcomes are observed. The censoring proportion is set to be 20 percent. </p>
</dd>
<dt>x</dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous variable which has U-shaped relationship with log relative hazard. </p>
</dd>
<dt>x1</dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous variable which has linear relationship with log relative hazard. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
