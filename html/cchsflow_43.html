<h2>Depression Scale - Predicted Probability</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not a function.
</p>
<p>This is categorical variable derived by Statistics Canada that predicts
the probability that a respondent would be diagnosed as having a major
depressive episode if a diagnostic interview was completed. This variable
is derived from <code>DPSDSF</code> in which probabilities are assigned
to respondents based on their depression scale score. For more details on
how the variable was derived click <a href="https://osf.io/auqwh/">here</a>.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DPSDPP(DPSDPP)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DPSDPP</code></td>
<td>
<p>cchsflow variable name for derived depression scale predicted
probability.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>While this variable was considered to be categorical in CCHS
documentation, the values range from 0 to 0.90 with no distinct names or
metadata for each category. As such, this variable was specified as a
continuous variable in cchsflow. This has no bearing on the final output 
of the variable as there are no recode changes. This means that a respondent
who was coded with a probability of 0.50 will still have a probability value
of 0.50 when the variable goes through harmonization.
</p>
<p>This variable is present in every CCHS cycle used in cchsflow, and
how it was derived remains consistent.
