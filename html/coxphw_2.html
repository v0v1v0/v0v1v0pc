<h2>  Biofeedback Treatment Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> In this study the effect of biofeedback treatment on time until treatment <code>success</code> 
was evaluated in patients suffering from aspiration after head and neck 
surgery. The outcome of interest was the time from start of treatment until the patient achieved full
swallowing rehabilitation (<code>thdur</code>). Patients were randomized into two groups (<code>bfb</code>): 
one group of patients received videoendoscopic biofeedback treatment; the other group received the 
conservative treatment including thermal stimulation with ice and exercises for the lips, tongue, 
laryngeal closure and elevation. Treatment was started as soon as the healing process after surgery 
was finished (<code>thealing</code>).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(biofeedback)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 33 observations on the following 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> the patient id. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>success</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> of treatment within the first 100 days; either 0 = no success or 1 = success. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>thdur</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> the duration of therapy in days. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bfb</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> indicates the treatment group; either 0 = conservative or 1 = biofeedback. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>theal</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> time from surgery to start of therapy in days. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>log2heal</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> log2-transformed time from surgery to start of therapy. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
