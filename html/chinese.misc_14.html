<h2>Check The Locale Functions are to Assume</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The locale setting of R is different on different operating systems or different versions of one system.
However, some functions in this package try to convert the locale setting of R to a new value.
The new value, by default, is 
"Chinese (Simplified)_China.936" in Windows, and "zh_CN.UTF-8" in other systems. But
users can modify this by <code>options(tmp_chi_locale = "...")</code> and then check this by 
<code>get_tmp_chi_locale( )</code>. Note: if this value is <code>NULL</code> or <code>NA</code>, it means no
locale modification will be done by functions in this package. If this value is "auto", it will be 
automatically converted to the default values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_tmp_chi_locale()
</code></pre>
