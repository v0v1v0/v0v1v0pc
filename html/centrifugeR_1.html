<h2>centrifugeR: Non-Trivial Balance of Centrifuge Rotors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the numbers of test tubes that can be balanced in centrifuge rotors and
show various ways to load them. Refer to Pham (2020)
<a href="https://doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/4xs38">doi:10.31224/osf.io/4xs38</a> for more information on package
functionality.
</p>


<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>centrifugeR helps obtain the perfect centrifuge balance.
Call <code>rotor</code> to know how many tubes can be loaded into the
rotor and see different ways to place these tubes. Alternatively, call
<code>launch</code> to run the Shiny app. Also, call
<code>rotorVerify</code> to verify the balance of pre-existing tube
configurations. Call <code>rotorSpeed</code> for RPM/RCF conversion.
