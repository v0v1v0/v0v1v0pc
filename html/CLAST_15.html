<h2>
Maximum likelihood estimator of p.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the ML estimator for each possible outcome of the sample space generated from a sequential design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ML.rank.SM(obj)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>

<p>a list with elements S, M and design, containing all possible values of total successes S and stopping stage M based on the given design. Typically this is the output of function sample.space or sample.space.2 and will also have elements Y and decision.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with element "lims" as well as all elements of argument obj. The extra element contains the ML estimator of p for each possible outcome.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">n=c(5,6,5,9)
a=c(2,4,5,12)
b=c(5,9,11,13)
# There are 364 possible outcomes from this design which are
# listed in a natural systematic order by function sample.space.
all.samples=sample.space(n,a,b)
attributes(all.samples)
# Y contains the 364 possible sequential binary outcomes;
# M contains how many stages before the decision;
# S contains the total number of success that produces the decision;
# decision the final binary test result of H0 or H1.
ML.rank.SM(obj=all.samples)$lims
# Component "lims" contains the value of the ML estimate i.e.
# total successes S divided by total trials N. The same ML
# estimator occurs for outcomes with the same values of (S,M).
