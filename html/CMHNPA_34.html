<h2>Traffic data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Traffic light data for different light sequences, intersections, and times of
day.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(traffic)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 25 rows and four columns.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>minutes</dt>
<dd>
<p>the amount of unused red-light time in minutes</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>the traffic light sequence</p>
</dd>
<dt>intersection</dt>
<dd>
<p>the intersection the <code>treatment</code> was applied</p>
</dd>
<dt>time_of_day</dt>
<dd>
<p>the time of the day the <code>treatment</code> was applied</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A traffic engineer conducted a study to compare the total unused red-light
time for five different traffic light signal sequences. The experiment was
conducted with a Latin square design in which blocking factors were (1) five
intersections and (2) five time of day periods.
