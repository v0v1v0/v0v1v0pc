<h2>Class "memrobmatrix"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Objects of class <code>'memrobmatrix'</code> hold the full membership robustness matrix generated from analysis of a consensus matrix. This
includes the calculations of membership robustness for all features (e.g. genes) for each cluster. This can be useful as it allows you to
see what conritbution a particular feature (e.g. gene) is making to other clusters. This could resonably be thought of as a measure similar
to 'fuzziness' i.e. partial cluster membership. If the value of the membership robustness for a feature is similar in many clusters then that
is additional evidence that the feature is not easily placed in any cluster.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>Objects can be created by calls of the form <code>new("memrobmatrix", ...)</code>, although they are usually generated internally by the <code>memrob</code> function. 
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
<code>mrm</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>"matrix"</code> - this is the full membership robustness matrix itself and therefore has the same dimensions as the
original data object used in the clustering</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">showClass("memrobmatrix")

#load cmr
data(testcmr);

#calculate membership robustness
mr &lt;- memrob(testcmr$e1_kmeans_k3)

#get the full membership robustness matrix (matrix itself held in slot 'mrm')
mrm &lt;- mr$resultmatrix@mrm;
