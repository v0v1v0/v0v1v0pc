<h2> Web Data Analysis by Bayesian Mixture of Markov Models </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>R</code> package <span class="pkg">clickb</span> is for web sequences analysis and classification.
One way to identify users' activity stages is relying on sequential data analysis, that aims to discover statistically relevant temporal structure 
where the values are delivered in sequences. 
In model-based clustering approach, longitudinal data are analysed and a model is trained to understand the underlying process generating the sequences.
Markov processes assume sequences having a parametric distribution and depend on each sequence elements conditional probability of occurrence while
satisfy the Markov property. In other words, these models allow to analyse patterns taking into account the probabilistic aspect of subjects movements
in the sequence by considering the possible realization of a categorical variable as states of the Markov chain. 
Furthermore, We can use their extension to mixture of first-order Markov models to identify clusters of sequences generated by the same Markov model
representing subpopulations in the data. Each subpopulation has its Markov model so that they may differ for the initial, transition or a combination.
In clickstream data context, these differences mean that sequences belonging to the same cluster describe different browsing behaviour, as they display
different preferences in starting the web path from a specific pages or to what web pages will be accessed in the next steps of the website exploration.
Parameter estimation can be obtained through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Baum et al., 1970) as used by Cadez et al. (2003) in clickstream
analysis context. However, we will use a Bayesian approach based on MCMC sampler considering Dirichlet priors for transition matrices rows as proposed by Fruehwirth-Schnatter and Pamminger (2010). 
This approach overcome a limitation of the EM algorithm that may struggle during the M-step if there are no transitions between two states.
The package contains suitable tools to estimate parameters in mixture of first-order time-discrete Markov models for categorical response in a Bayesian 
framework, identifying clusters of sequences under the assumption that number of mixture components is considered fixed. The algorithm is based on Gibbs
sampler moves and at each iteration assign web sequences in the new clusters based on a posterior probability. If simulated data are used or a previous
classification is available, the algorithm compare the original cluster labels and the new ones through the Danon similarity index (Danon et al., 2005).
