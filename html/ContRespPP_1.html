<h2>Example Continuous Response ANOVA Dataset.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing an example test set result to run a predictive probability model
with a continuous response variable.
This data set is a result of a 2^4 full factorial with five replicates that included five
main effects, with two-way interactions (excluding two-way interactions for the third factor).
This design has a power of 80%, with an 80% confidence level, to detect a difference of 50
units with a standard deviation of 100 units.
