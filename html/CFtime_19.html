<h2>Extend a CFtime object with additional offsets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>CFtime</code> instance can be extended by adding additional offsets using this
operator.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'CFtime,numeric'
e1 + e2
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e1</code></td>
<td>
<p>CFtime. Instance of the <code>CFtime</code> class.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e2</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. Vector of offsets to be added to the <code>CFtime</code> instance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resulting <code>CFtime</code> instance will have its offsets in the order that they
are added, meaning that the offsets from the <code>CFtime</code> instance come first and
those from the numeric vector follow. There is no reordering or removal of
duplicates. This is because the time series are usually associated with a
data set and the correspondence between the two is thus preserved, if and
only if the data sets are merged in the same order.
</p>
<p>Note that when adding multiple vectors of offsets to a <code>CFtime</code> instance, it
is more efficient to first concatenate the vectors and then do a final
addition to the <code>CFtime</code> instance. So avoid <code>CFtime(definition, calendar, e1) + CFtime(definition, calendar, e2) + CFtime(definition, calendar, e3) + ...</code>
but rather do <code>CFtime(definition, calendar) + c(e1, e2, e3, ...)</code>. It is the
responsibility of the operator to ensure that the offsets of the different
data sets are in reference to the same datum.
</p>
<p>Note also that <code>RNetCDF</code> and <code>ncdf4</code> packages both return the values of the
"time" dimension as a 1-dimensional array. You have to <code>dim(time_values) &lt;- NULL</code>
to de-class the array to a vector before adding offsets to an existing CFtime
instance.
</p>
<p>Negative offsets will generate an error.
</p>
<p>Any bounds that were set will be removed. Use <code>bounds()</code> to retrieve
the bounds of the individual <code>CFtime</code> instances and then set them again after
merging the two instances.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>CFtime</code> object with offsets composed of the <code>CFtime</code> instance and
the numeric vector.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e1 &lt;- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "gregorian", 0:364)
e2 &lt;- 365:729
e1 + e2
</code></pre>
