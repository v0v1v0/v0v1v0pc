<h2>Estimation of Average Treatment Effects (ATE) of Point Intervention on Time-to-Event Outcomes with Competing Risks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package accompanies the paper of Charpignon et al. (2022).
It can be applied to data with any number of competing events, including the case of only one type of event.
The method uses propensity scores weighting for emulation of baseline randomization.
The package implements different types of weights: ATE, stabilized ATE,
ATT, ATC and overlap weights, as described in Li et al. (2018),
and different treatment effect measures (hazard ratios, risk differences, risk ratios,
and restricted mean time differences).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">causalCmprsk</span> package provides two main functions:
<code>fit.cox</code> that assumes Cox proportional hazards structural models for cause-specific hazards,
and <code>fit.nonpar</code> that does not assume any model for potential outcomes.
The function <code>get.weights</code> returns estimated weights that are aimed for
emulation of a baseline randomization in observational data where the treatment was not assigned randomly, and where conditional exchangeability is assumed.
The function <code>get.pointEst</code> extracts a point estimate corresponding to a specific time point
from the time-varying functionals returned by <code>fit.cox</code> and <code>fit.nonpar</code>.
The function <code>get.numAtRisk</code> allows to obtain the number-at-risk statistic
in the raw and weighted data.
