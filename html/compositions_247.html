<h2>Firework mixtures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data show two measured properties, brilliance and vorticity, of 81 girandoles
composed of different mixtures of five ingredients: a â€“ e.
Of these ingredients, a and b are the primary light-producting, 
c is principal propellant, and d and e are binding agents for c. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Firework)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data consist of 81 cases and 7 variables: ingredients a, b, c, d, and e, 
and the two measured properties <em>brilliance</em> and <em>vorticity</em>.
The 81 different mixtures form a special experiment design. First the 81 
possible quadruples formed from the three values -1, 0, 1 were arranged 
in ascending order. Then for each such quadruple z, the corresponding mixture
x(z)=(a,b,c,d,e)=alrInv(z) is computed. Thus the No. 4 girandole corresponds 
to z=(-1,-1,0,-1) and so is composed of a mixture x=(.12,.12,.32,.12,.32) 
of the five ingredients. All 5-part mixtures sum up to one.</p>
