<h2>A Package to Fit the Cox Regression from Right Truncated Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The method assumes that truncation is independent of covariates,
and of lifetime, and that there is no censoring.
The method uses Inverse-Probability-Weighting estimating equations with stabilized weights,
IPW-S and IPW-SA, as described in Vakulenko-Lagun et al. (2018).
Currently the code allows only time-independent covariates.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">coxrt</span> package provides two functions:
<code>coxph.RT</code> (IPW-S) that assumes positivity
and <code>coxph.RT.a0</code> (IPW-SA) that allows
for adjustment of estimation using plugged-in <code>a0</code>.
The illustrative examples in these functions include analysis of AIDS
latency data with age as a covariate, where the AIDS cases were retrospectively
ascertained at June 30, 1986, and only those who developed AIDS by that time were
included in the analysis (Kalbfeisch and Lawless, 1989).
