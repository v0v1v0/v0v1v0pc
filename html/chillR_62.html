<h2>Makes a list of the UC IPM weather stations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Makes a list of the weather stations contained in the UC IPM database, with
geographic coordinates. This requires parsing through quite a few websites,
because the coordinates don't seem to be stored in one central (and easily
accessible) place. Hence this is much slower than one might expect. A
shortcut is the california_stations dataset supplied with chillR, which
contains the result of running this function in February 2016. The default
in the other relevant functions will be the use of this pre-stored list, but
if the current station coverage is needed, this function can help. Having
said this, station coverage probably won't change very rapidly, so in most
cases, the california_stations dataset should be enough.
