<h2>colorDF – colorful data frames in your terminal</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>colorDF – colorful data frames in your terminal
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>colorDF allows you to view data frames using the color and styling
capabilities of an ANSI terminal: 216 colors! 16 base colors! 24 shades of
gray! Italic, bold, inverse <em>and</em> underline! Well, OK, this may not seem much, but in
fact it allows at highlighting, showing different column types or coloring significant
p-values in red. Trust me, it is useful if you work a lot with huge data
frames.
</p>
<p>colorDF does not really introduce a new type of a data frame; when
applied to tibbles, data frames or data tables it does not change their
behavior except for the print method. In other words, it is only a
visualization layer on top of a data frame like object, which will
otherwise work exactly as expected.

<h3>Known issues</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> In Rstudio, inverse does not work correctly (known bug in Rstudio 1.3)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> colorDF relies on the crayon package. In certain
instances, the crayon package will enforce only 8 basic colors even if more
colors can be displayed. See the vignette of colorDF for an example and on
how to deal with this issue.
