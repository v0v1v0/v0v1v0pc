<h2>A Conformal Prediction  R Package for Classification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The conformalClassification package implements Transductive Conformal Prediction (TCP) and
Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for classification problems.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, the pakcage is built upon random forests method, where voting of random forests for each
class is considered as a conformity scores for each data point. Mainly the package generates
conformal prediction errors (p-values) for classification problems, it also provides various diagnostic
measures such as deviation from alidity, error rate, efficiency, observed fuzziness and calibration plots.
In future releases, we plan to extend package to use other
machine learning algorithms, (i.e. support vector machine) for model fitting.
