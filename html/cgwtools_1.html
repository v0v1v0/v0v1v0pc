<h2> A collection of tools that the author finds handy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Most of these tools are small functions to do simple tasks or provide filtered views of the current environment.  In addition the function <code>splatnd</code> is provided primarily as a piece of example code to show how to write zero-argument operators. It's based on the code in the package  <code>sos</code> , and avoids the need to use <code>makeActiveBinding</code> (as in ,e.g., <code>pracma::ans</code>  )
