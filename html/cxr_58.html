<h2>Metapopulation dynamics coefficients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A nested list containing vital rate coefficients for projecting
metapopulation dynamics.
The first level of the list has 3 elements, one for each species modelled.
The second level of the list has 2 elements, one for each site modelled.
For each combination species-site, there is a data.frame of eight rows -
one per each vital rate, and eight columns - one per coefficient, that
correspond to the coefficients of a GLM. These are named as <code>alpha</code>,<code>beta1</code>,
etc, in the data.frame, and correspond to the intercept, environmental effect,
effects of each of the three species' density, and environment:density interactions
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(metapopulation_example_param)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A nested list with 3x2 elements, each of which a dataframe
of 8 rows and 8 numeric columns
