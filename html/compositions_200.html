<h2>Artic lake sediment samples of different water depth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sand, silt and clay compositions of 39 sediment samples of different water depth
in an Arctic lake. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ArcticLake)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sand, silt and clay compositions of 39 sediment samples at different water depth (in meters)
in an Arctic lake. The additional feature is a concomitant variable or <em>covariate,</em>
water depth, which may account for some of the variation in the compositions.
In statistical terminology we have a multivariate regression problem with sediment composition 
as regressand and water depth as regressor.
</p>
<p>All row percentage sums to 100, except for rounding errors.
