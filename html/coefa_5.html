<h2>PCA and EFA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Choosing an appropriate method to extract factor from the aggregated
co-occurrence matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coefa_fa(R, nfactors, methodcoefa, rotate, fm)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix. R is the pooled co-occurrence matrix obtained from the last step.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nfactors</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of factors could be extracted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>methodcoefa</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method choosing factor model(i.e.PCA or EFA)."PCA" is
principal component analysis,"EFA" is exploratory factor analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rotate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rotate parameter has many options to be chosen. They are:
"none", "varimax", "quartimax", "bentlerT", "equamax", "varimin", "geominT"
and "bifactor" are orthogonal rotations. "Promax", "promax", "oblimin",
"simplimax", "bentlerQ, "geominQ" and "biquartimin" and "cluster".According
to Shafer (2005, 2006), the only correct choice is “varimax”, because the
aggregated co-occurrence matrix is different from a correlation matrix or
a covariance matrix in essence. The default is to do a oblimin transformation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fm</code></td>
<td>
<p>This parameter also has many options.When fm="minres", it will do
a minimum residual, as will fm="uls". Both of them use a first derivative.
What should be noted is that the fm="uls" is recommend by experts because
it don’t request the normality and positive as two prerequisites.The fm="ols"
differs very slightly from "minres" in that it minimizes the entire residual
matrix using an OLS procedure but uses the empirical first derivative.
This will be slower.The fm="wls" will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution;
the fm="gls" does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS); and the fm="pa"
will do the principal factor solution, fm="ml" will do a maximum likelihood
factor analysis. The fm="minchi" will minimize the sample size weighted chi
square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects
per pair. The fm ="minrank" will do a minimum rank factor analysis.
The "old.min" will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April,
2017. The fm="alpha" will starts an alpha factor analysis as described in
Kaiser and Coffey (1965).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It should be noted that we should be alert to the positive
definiteness of the aggregated matrix. If the matrix is non-positive
definite, we should choose the factor extraction method carefully or we
should take other solutions (remove questions appropriately, or smooth
the matrix).
