<h2>Sort files in a folder, so that numbers are in ascending sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sometimes lists of strings that contain numbers aren't listed automatically in the sequence
we would expect, e.g. because numbers below ten are lacking leading zeros (as in
c("a1","a10","a100","a11"...)). This function recognizes all shared leading and trailing
symbols around the numeric part of such strings and sorts the list according to the embedded
numbers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ordered_climate_list(strings, file_extension = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strings</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of character strings to be sorted according to embedded numbers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file_extension</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string specifying the extension of the file type to be selected.
This can also be any other trailing string that marks all vector elements to be selected. This isn't
required for the function to run, but may be necessary if the string list of interest contains, for
instance, different file types, of which you only want to work with one.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>subset of the strings vector that only contains the elements that end on file_extension and
are sorted in ascending order according to the numeric parts of the strings.
