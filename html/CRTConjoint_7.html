<h2>Immigration Choice Conjoint Experiment Data from Hainmueller et. al. (2014).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is a subset of the first 1000 rows chosen from the original immigration dataset.
Each row consists of a pair of immigrant candidates that were shown to respondents.
The respondent then chooses either the left or right profile (main binary response) from
the nine profile factors shown for each candidate. Respondent characteristics are also recorded.
For example, the first row shows that the left immigrant candidate was a Male from Iraq
who had a high school degree, etc. while the right immigrant candidate was a Female from France
with no formal education, etc. The respondent who evaluated this task was a 20 year old
college educated White Male, who voted for the left immigrant candidate.
