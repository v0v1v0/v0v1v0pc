<h2>
Helicase Dependent Amplification of HPRT1 with different input DNA 
quantities using the Bio-Rad iQ5 thermo cycler
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) of HPRT1 (Homo sapiens 
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) was performed at three different 
input DNA quantities using the Bio-Rad iQ5 thermo cycler. The HDA was 
performed at 65 degrees Celsius. The optimal temperature for a HDA is circa 
65 degrees Celsius. Lower temperatures will affect the slope and plateau of 
the HDA amplification curve.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(C67)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 43 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Cycles.C67</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing the cycle numbers</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>t.C67</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing the time elapsed 
between the cycles. The time was calculated by the cycle duration of one
iQ5 thermocycler step (71 seconds / step).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To perform an isothermal amplification in 'VideoScan', standard conditions 
for the IsoAmp(R) III Universal tHDA Kit (Biohelix) were used. The reaction 
was composed of 12.5 micro L buffer A containing 1.25 micro L 10x reaction 
buffer, 150 nM primer (forward and reverse), 0.75  micro L template 
(synthetic) and A. bidest which was covered with 50 micro L mineral oil. 
The primer sequences for HPRT1 were taken from Roediger et al. (2013). 
Preincubation: This mixture was incubated for 2 min at 95 degree. Celsius 
and immediately placed on ice. 12.5 micro L of reaction buffer B which was 
composed of 1.25 micro L 10x buffer, 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1.75 micro L 
dNTPs, 0.2 x EvaGreen, 1 micro L Enzyme mix and A. bidest. The fluorescence 
measurement started directly after adding buffer B and the preincubation step.
Temperature profile if the iQ5 thermo cycler (after Preincubation):
- 60 seconds at 65 degrees Celsius 
- 11 seconds at 55 degrees Celsius &amp;&amp; Measurement
