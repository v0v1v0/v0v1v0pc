<h2>Extensive Growth and Yield Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provide an extensive compilation of growth and yield related results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">growth_and_yield_evaluation(sim_agg, concept_def, detailed_out = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim_agg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Aggregated simulated area dynamics, more precisely, the output
of <code>aggregate_raw_sim_rslt</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>concept_def</code></td>
<td>
<p>Concept definition matching <code>sim_agg</code>, a
<code>c4c_concept</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>detailed_out</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean, if TRUE, also pre-evaluation output (calculated
by the internal function growth_and_yield_pre_eval) will be part of the
result list (default = FALSE)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The result object, a list, contains the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>gyield_summary</em>: A tibble that contains phase overarching growth
and yield information. In this tibble, each row is a point in time. The
columns (in addition to time) are: <em>vol_standing</em>, the standing volume on
the total area of interest; <em>vol_rmv_cont</em>,the continuous removals that
take place, as long as an area is in a given phase; <em>vol_rmv_trans</em>, the
volume removals occurring at phase transitions from phases with more to
such with less standing volume; <em>vol_rmv_damage</em>, the volume losses due
to damage events; <em>vol_rmv_harvest</em>, regular harvest volume, the sum of
vol_rmv_cont and vol_rmv_trans; <em>vol_rmv_total</em>, all removed volume, the
sum of vol_rmv_harvest and vol_rmv_damage; <em>vol_mort</em>, the mortality
volume (normal, not event-triggered); <em>vol_inc</em>, the volume increment on
the whole area resulting from the vol_standing, vol_rmv_total,
and vol_mort.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>gyield_phases</em>: A list of tibbles, one for each variable as
contained in gyield_summary (except the volume increment) which makes no
sense in a phase-wise context), but in phase-wise resolution. In each
tibble, each row is a point in time, the columns represent the stand
development phases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>gyield_pre</em> (in case the user has chosen
<code>detailed_out = TRUE</code>): A tibble, where each row is a point in
time. The columns (in addition to time) are: <em>vol_standing</em>, the standing
volume on the total area of interest; <em>vol_rmv_cont</em>,the continuous
removals that take place, as long as an area is in a given phase;
<em>vol_rmv_trans</em>, the volume removals occurring at phase transitions from
phases with more to such with less standing volume;<em>vol_rmv_damage</em>, the
volume losses due to damage events; <em>vol_rmv_harvest</em>, regular harvest
volume, the sum of vol_rmv_cont and vol_rmv_trans; <em>vol_rmv_total</em>, all
removed volume, the sum of vol_rmv_harvest and vol_rmv_damage;
<em>vol_mort</em>, the mortality volume (normal, not event-triggered);
<em>vol_inc</em>, the volume increment on the whole area resulting from the
vol_standing, vol_rmv_total, and vol_mort.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two elements (see also details),
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>gyield_summary</em>: A tibble that contains phase overarching growth
and yield information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>gyield_phases</em>: A list of tibbles, each one representing one of the
growth and yield variables also found in gyield_summary, but here on the
level of the single stand development phases.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user has selected <code>detailed_out = TRUE</code>, there will also be
another list element, <em>gyield_pre</em>, which contains the interim information
from which gyield_summary and gyield_phases are calculated.
</p>
