<h2>Concatenate a set of solution results into one set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Merges several sets of optimization results from
multiple calls to <code>findstysols</code> into 
a single object for further analysis</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mergexy(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>An unspecified number of arguments of class <code>csFSS</code>.
(usually a set of objects containing a set of optimization solutions,
such as that returned by <code>findstysols</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The return object from an invocation of the
<code>findstysols</code> is a list containing a number
of interesting components containing information about
the starting parameters, the (hopefully optimal) ending
parameters, convergence status, minimum variance achieved
and p-value associated with the final test of stationarity
after an optimization.
</p>
<p>It is possible to ask <code>findstysols</code> to execute
multiple optimization runs in the same function, by choice of
the <code>Nsims</code> parameter. However, for truly large runs,
it can be convenient to run multiple copies of
<code>findstysols</code>, for example on multiple processors
simultaneously (a coarse grained parallelism).
</p>
<p>In particular, for large time series, it can be useful to run
<code>findstysols</code> for <b>one</b> optimization run
(as running more than one for a very large series can cause the
software to fail as R can run out of memory. Actually, for very
very large series even one optmization run can fail for memory
reasons). 
</p>
<p>In this way multiple optimization runs can be executed with each
one producing its own set of results. This function
(<code>mergexy</code>) takes a list of object names of all of the results,
and merges the results into one object as if a single call
to <code>findstysols</code> had been executed. Such a single
set of results can then be passed on to further analysis
routines, such as <code>COEFbothscale</code> or
<code>LCTSres</code>.
</p>
