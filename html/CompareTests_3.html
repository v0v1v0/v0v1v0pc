## The function is currently defined as
function (...)
{
  ## Purpose: Add the margins automatically and don't exclude NA/NaN as its own row/column
  ##          and also add row/column titles.  Works for mixed numeric/factor variables.
  ##          For factors, the exclude option won't include the NAs as columns, that's why
  ##          I need to do more work.

  # This works for purely numeric input, but not for any factors b/c exclude=NULL won't
  # include NAs for them.
  #   return(addmargins(table(...,exclude=NULL)))

  ##
  # Factors are harder.  I have to reconstruct each factor to include NA as a level
  ##
  
  # Put everything into a data frame
  x &lt;- data.frame(...)

  # For each factor (in columns), get the raw levels out, reconstruct to include NAs
  # That is, if there are any NAs -- if none, add it as a level anyway
  for (i in 1:dim(x)[2]) {
    if ( is.factor(x[,i]) )
      if ( any(is.na(x[,i])) )
        x[,i] &lt;- factor(unclass(x[,i]),labels=c(levels(x[,i]),"NA"),exclude=NULL)
      else
        levels(x[,i]) &lt;- c(levels(x[,i]),"NA")
  }

  # Make table with margins.  Since NA is a level in each factor, they'll be included
  return(addmargins(table(x,exclude=NULL)))
