<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dynamic treatment effect estimation for assessing the average effects of sequences of treatments (consisting of two sequential treatments). Combines estimation based on (doubly robust) efficient score functions with double machine learning to control for confounders in a data-driven way.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Estimation of the causal effects of sequences of two treatments under sequential conditional independence, assuming that all confounders of the treatment in either period and the outcome of interest are observed. Estimation is based on the (doubly robust) efficient score functions for potential outcomes, see e.g. Bodory, Huber, and Laffers (2020), in combination with double machine learning with cross-fitting, see Chernozhukov et al (2018). To this end, one part of the data is used for estimating the model parameters of the treatment and outcome equations based machine learning. The other part of the data is used for predicting the efficient score functions. The roles of the data parts are swapped (using 3-fold cross-fitting) and the average dynamic treatment effect is estimated based on averaging the predicted efficient score functions in the total sample.
Standard errors are based on asymptotic approximations using the estimated variance of the (estimated) efficient score functions.
