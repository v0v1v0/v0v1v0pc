<h2>Generated example data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A generated data set containing two multivariate data sets: X and Y, which
represent the set of covariates and responses, respectively. The covariance
matrix of Y has a compound symmetry structure with heterogeneous variances.
Both variances and correlations are functions of the covariates. X variables
are generated from the standard normal distribution. The correlations are
generated with a logit model and the variances are functions of these
generated correlations. The sample size is 200. There are 3 covariates and 3
response variables. x1 and x2 are the importantvariables for the varying
covariance matrix of Y. x3 is the noise variable.
