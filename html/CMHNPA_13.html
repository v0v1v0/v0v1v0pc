<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Applications for a position are vetted and ranked by Human Resource
(HR) professionals. The top five are interviewed by a selection committee of
ten. Each member of the committee gives an initial ranking of the applicants
and no one on the committee sees either the ranking by the HR professionals
or the initial rankings of the other committee members. Ties are not
permitted in any ranking. It is of interest to know if the rankings of the HR
professionals and the initial rankings of the selection committee are
correlated.
