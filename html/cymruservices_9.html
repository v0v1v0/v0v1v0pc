<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bogons are defined as Martians (private and reserved addresses defined by RFC 1918,
RFC 5735, and RFC 6598) and netblocks that have not been allocated to a regional
internet registry (RIR) by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
</p>
<p>Fullbogons are a larger set which also includes IP space that has been allocated to
an RIR, but not assigned by that RIR to an actual ISP or other end-user. IANA maintains
a convenient IPv4 summary page listing allocated and reserved netblocks, and each RIR
maintains a list of all prefixes that they have assigned to end-users. Our bogon reference
pages include additional links and resources to assist those who wish to properly filter
bogon prefixes within their networks.
