<h2>Convert a character vector to a numeric integer for setting a reproducible seed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>char2seed()</code> is a parlor trick for converting a character vector into an integer for the sake of setting a reproducible seed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">char2seed(x)

char2seed_v1(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Interested users can see how this works. Namely, letters (and numbers) in the character vector are assigned corresponding numbers. In
<code>char2seed()</code>, these numbers are concatenated together an divided over 1 minus the absolute maximum number that R can handle by
default (2^32). The remainder of this division is what ultimately becomes the reproducible seed.
</p>
<p>In <code>char2seed_v1()</code>, these numbers are added together and then exponentiated to create a really big number. The number is divided over
1 minus the absolute maximum number that R can handle by default (2^32). The remainder of this division is what ultimately becomes the
reproducible seed.
</p>
<p>The nature of this parlor trick means there's a possibility, however small, that two different character vectors
can return the same reproducible seed. This happened before <a href="https://github.com/svmiller/codename/issues/1">https://github.com/svmiller/codename/issues/1</a>, which is why
I changed the function for generating the seed and moved the old function to <code>char2seed_v1()</code>.
</p>
<p>The function may warn of "loss of accuracy", but this just means you supplied it a really long character vector.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>char2seed()</code> takes a character vector and returns a reproducible seed for you to use for whatever purpose. It's used internally in
<code>codename()</code>. <code>char2seed_v1()</code> does the same, but using the older method from v. 0.1.0 and v. 0.2.0 of this release.
