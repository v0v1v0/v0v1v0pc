<h2>Physical activity and body mass index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'bmi_activity' data set records the proportion of daily time spent to sleep
(sleep), sedentary behaviour (sedent), light physical activity (Lpa), moderate
physical activity (Mpa) and vigorous physical activity (Vpa) measured on a small
population of 393 children. Moreover the standardized body mass index (zBMI) of
each child was also registered.
</p>
<p>This data set was used in the example of the article (Dumuid et al. 2019) to examine the
expected differences in zBMI for reallocations of daily time between sleep, physical
activity and sedentary behaviour. Because the original data is confidential, the
data set BMIPhisActi includes simulated data that mimics the main features of the
original data.
