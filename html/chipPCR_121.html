<h2>
Wrapper for Several Smoothers of Amplification Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Smoother is a wrapper for several smoothing functions including LOWESS, 
Moving Average, Friedman's SuperSmoother, Cubic Spline and Savitzky-Golay 
smoothing filter, Friedman's SuperSmoother, and Whittaker smoother for 
amplification curve 
data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'numeric,numeric'
smoother(x, y, trans = FALSE, 
		    bg.outliers = FALSE, method = "savgol", 
		    CPP = TRUE, paralell = NULL)
## S4 method for signature 'matrix,missing'
smoother(x, y, trans = FALSE, 
		    bg.outliers = FALSE, method = "savgol",

regression, "mova" for moving average, "savgol" for Savitzky-Golay 
smoothing filter, "smooth" for cubic spline smooth, "spline" for standard 
cubic spline smooth, "supsmu" for Friedman's SuperSmoother, "whit1" for 
weighted Whittaker smoothing with a first order finite difference penalty, 
"whit2" for weighted Whittaker smoothing with a second order finite 
difference penalty or "all" for all implemented smoothing algorithms. Both 
upper and lower case names are accepted.

pre-processor) should be used.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Amplification curve data of experimental thermo-cyclers may deliver results 
which are hard to interpret due to noise and scatter. For data presentation 
it is often useful to smooth or filter the data prior to presentation. 
Smoothing and filtering are different approaches with a similar outcome to 
preprocess an input signal in order to make it available for an analysis 
step. Filtering uses methods of signal processing. They take a data input 
and apply a function to form an output. There are linear and non-linear 
filters. The most common example of a linear filter is the the moving 
average. A moving average filter replaces sequentially data points with the 
average of the neighbor data points. The average is calculated from a 
defined span ("window") of odd count (e.g., 3, 5). The average herein may 
also refer to the median, the geometric or exponential mean. Smoothing in 
contrast uses statistical approaches. Such approaches use for example local 
regression models (e.g., least squares estimate) or cubic splines. Splines apply 
non-parametric regression by local cubic polynomials between knot points. Other 
examples for smoothers include Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter, Friedman's 
SuperSmoother, and Whittaker smoother. Several methods were integrated in the 
<code>chipPCR</code> package. A careful evaluation of this preprocessing step is of 
high importance (Spiess et al. 2014).
</p>
<p><code>smoother</code> is a wrapper for smoother 
functions and filters commonly used to process amplification curve data. 
The <code>smoother</code> function was enhanced by functionality 
of the <code>fixNA</code> and <code>CPP</code> 
functions. The parameter "lowess" for LOWESS smoother (locally-weighted 
polynomial regression) can be tuned by the parameters <code>f</code> and 
<code>iter</code> (see <code>lowess</code> for details). The parameter 
"mova" for moving average can be tuned by the parameter <code>movaww</code>. 
<code>movaww</code> is the window size used for the moving average (see 
<code>filter</code> for details). The parameter "savgol" for 
Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter can be tuned by the parameter <code>p</code> and 
<code>n</code> (see <code>sgolayfilt</code> for details). The parameter 
"smooth" for cubic spline smooth can be tuned by the parameter <code>df.fact</code>. 
A <code>df.fact</code> value of 1 will leave the raw data almost unaffected while a 
value 0.5 will smooth the curve considerably. For further details refer to 
the <code>smooth.spline</code> function. The parameter "spline" for 
standard cubic spline smooth has currently no additional parameter. The 
parameter "supsmu" for Friedman's SuperSmoother can be tuned by the 
parameter <code>span</code>. For further details refer to the 
<code>supsmu</code> function. The parameter "lambda" is used in 
Weighted Whittaker smoothing.
