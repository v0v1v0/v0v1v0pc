<h2>Log Logistic Formula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Log Logistic Formula
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Log_Logistic_Formula(concentration, scale, shape_location)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>concentration</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of concentration values for a selected pesticide,
that has a Log Logistic shaped species sensitivity distribution,
to run the equation on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Log Logistic alpha/scale value for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shape_location</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Log Logistic beta/shape value for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric vector
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Imazapic &lt;- c(0.000000001, 0.5, 2.7, 11)
#Imazapic is used as its species sensitivity distribution plots fits Log Logistic
Log_Logistic_Formula(concentration = Imazapic,
scale = pesticide_info$scale[pesticide_info$pesticide == "Imazapic"],
shape_location = pesticide_info$shape_location[pesticide_info$pesticide == "Imazapic"])
