<h2>Periodogram</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the best-fitting period using iterative cosinor procedure.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">periodogram(data, time, periods = time, na.action = na.omit,
  alpha = 0.05)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing responses of subjects collected over time, with subjects in the rows and timepoints in the columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the times at which the data was collected. If this vector includes midnight, it should be coded as 24 instead of 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>periods</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing periods that are to be included in the periodogram. Defaults to the same periods as provided in the vector <code>time</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>
<p>Action to be performed on missing values. Defaults to <code>na.omit</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Significance level for determining if a rhythm with a given period is significant or not. Defaults to .05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Iterative cosinor procedure is performed as described in Klemfuss &amp; Clopton (1993). Cosinor is performed iteratively with the period (<code class="reqn">\tau</code>) increased by 1 in each iteration. Percent Rhythm is calculated in each iteration, which allows for an estimation of the best fitting period. A periodogram can be plotted, which shows Percent Rhythm (coefficient of determination) for each period. On the plot, periods with significant rhythm are shown as a point and periods with insignificant rhythm are shown as a cross.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The range of periods included in iterations starts from 3 (sinusoidality of the curve is not achieved for <code class="reqn">\tau</code> &lt; 3) and ends with the number of timepoints in the data.
