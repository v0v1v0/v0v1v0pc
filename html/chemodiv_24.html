<h2>Quickly calculate or plot chemodiversity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is a shortcut that makes use of many of the other functions
in the package. In one simple step chemodiversity is calculated, and if
requested also plotted, for users wanting to quickly explore their
data using standard parameters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">quickChemoDiv(
  sampleData,
  compoundData = NULL,
  groupData = NULL,
  outputType = "plots"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampleData</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the relative concentration of each
compound (column) in every sample (row).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compoundData</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the compounds in <code>sampleData</code>
as rows. Should have a column named "compound" with common names of
the compounds, a column named "smiles" with SMILES IDs of the compounds,
and a column named "inchikey" with the InChIKey IDs for the compounds.
See <code>chemodiv</code> for details on obtaining SMILES and InChIKey IDs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groupData</code></td>
<td>
<p>Grouping data (e.g. population, species etc.).
Should be either a vector, or a data frame with a single column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outputType</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of output that should be returned: either
<code>data</code> to output a list with different types of chemodiversity data,
or <code>plots</code> to instead produce standard plots of this data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function requires sample data as input, and can also include
compound data. <code>chemoDivCheck</code> can be used to ensure these
datasets are correctly formatted, see <code>chemodiv</code> for further
details on data formatting. If only sample data is supplied,
phytochemical diversity and dissimilarity will be calculated
as Hill diversity and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, respectively.
If sample data and compound data is supplied, phytochemical diversity
and dissimilarity will be calculated as Functional Hill diversity
and Generalized UniFrac dissimilarity, respectively.
This function then uses the following other functions in the package:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>compDis</code> is used to calculate compound dissimilarities
using PubChem Fingerprints, if compound data is supplied.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>calcDiv</code> is used to calculate (Functional) Hill
Diversity for q = 1.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>calcDivProf</code> is used to calculate a diversity profile
with (Functional) Hill Diversity for <em>q</em> = 0-3.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sampDis</code> is used to calculate Bray-Curtis or
Generalized UniFrac dissimilarities between samples.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chemoDivPlot</code> is used to create different
chemodiversity plots if requested.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>quickChemoDiv</code> is designed to provide an easy way to calculate and
visualize the most central measures of phytochemical diversity. It uses
default parameters to do so, which should be reasonable in most cases.
However, for detailed analyses it is recommended to use the separate
functions to allow for full control of function input, arguments and output.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Different types of chemodiversity measures, either as elements in
a list or as separate plots. If <code>outputType = "data"</code>, function returns
a compound dissimilarity matrix (if compound data was supplied),
a data frame with (Functional) Hill Diversity at <em>q</em> = 1,
a data frame with a (Functional) Hill Diversity profile for <em>q</em> = 0-3,
and a sample dissimilarity matrix. If <code>outputType = "plots"</code>,
these data sets are plotted as a dendrogram (if compound data was supplied),
a boxplot, a diversity profile plot and an NMDS plot, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(minimalCompData)
data(minimalSampData)
groups &lt;- c("A", "A", "B", "B")
quickChemoDiv(sampleData = minimalSampData, groupData = groups,
outputType = "data") # Without compound data

data(alpinaSampData)
data(alpinaPopData)
quickChemoDiv(sampleData = alpinaSampData, outputType = "plots",
groupData = alpinaPopData) # Without compound data
</code></pre>
