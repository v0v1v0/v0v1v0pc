<h2>clipp: Calculate Likelihoods by Pedigree Paring</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>clipp</code> provides a fast and general implementation of the Elston-Stewart
algorithm, and can calculate the log-likelihoods of large and complex pedigrees,
including those with loops.  General references for the Elston-Stewart algorithm are
(Elston &amp; Stewart, 1971), (Lange &amp; Elston, 1975) and (Cannings et al., 1978).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main function is <code>pedigree_loglikelihood</code>, which calculates
the pedigree likelihood on page 117 of (Lange, 2002) for almost any choice of
genotype frequencies, transmission matrix and penetrance matrix.  Helper
functions are provided to calculate the genotype frequencies and transmission
matrices for genetic models that often arise in applications.  The function
<code>genotype_probabilities</code> calculates genotype probabilities
for a target person within a family, given the family's phenotypes.
</p>
<p>The <code>clipp</code> package can handle pedigree loops, such as those
caused by inbreeding or by two sisters having children with two brothers
from an unrelated family (see (Totir et al., 2009) for a precise definition).
However, pedigrees with more than a few loops could greatly reduce the speed
of the calculation.
</p>
<p>It is feasible to apply <code>clipp</code> to very large families.  For instance,
in the examples for <code>pedigree_loglikelihood</code>,
the log-likelihood of one family with approximately 10,000 members is calculated
in less than one minute on a standard desktop computer.
Numerical issues will eventually limit the family size,
though <code>clipp</code> takes care to avoid arithmetic underflow and other issues.
