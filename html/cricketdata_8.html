<h2>Fetch Player Meta Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fetch player meta data from ESPNCricinfo and return a tibble with one line
per player. To identify the players, use their Cricinfo player IDs.
The simplest way to find this is to look up their Cricinfo Profile page. The number
at the end of the URL is the ID. For example, Meg Lanning's profile page is
http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/329336.html,
so her ID is 329336.
