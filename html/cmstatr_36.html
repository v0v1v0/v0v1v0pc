<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The k-factors returned by this function are used for determining
whether to accept a new dataset.
</p>
<p>This function is used as part of the procedure for
determining acceptance limits for a sample mean and sample minimum.
These acceptance limits are often used to set acceptance limits for
material strength for each lot of material, or each new manufacturing
site. When a sample meets the criteria that its mean and its minimum are
both greater than these limits, then one may accept the lot of material
or the new manufacturing site.
</p>
<p>This procedure is used to ensure that the strength of material processed
at a second site, or made with a new batch of material are not degraded
relative to the data originally used to determine basis values for the
material. For more information about the use of this procedure, see
CMH-17-1G or PS-ACE 100-2002-006.
</p>
<p>According to Vangel (2002), the use of mean and extremum for this purpose
is more powerful than the use of mean and standard deviation.
</p>
<p>The results of this function match those published by Vangel within
0.05\
by Vangel are identical to those published in CMH-17-1G.
</p>
<p>This function uses numerical integration and numerical optimization to
find values of the factors <code class="reqn">k_1</code> and <code class="reqn">k_2</code> based on Vangel's
saddle point approximation.
</p>
<p>The value <code class="reqn">n</code> refers to the number of observations in the sample
being compared with the original population (the qualification sample is
usually assumed to be equal to the population statistics).
</p>
<p>The value of <code class="reqn">alpha</code> is the acceptable probability of a type I error.
Normally, this is set to 0.05 for material or process equivalency and 0.01
when setting lot acceptance limits. Though, in principle, this parameter
can be set to any number between 0 and 1. This function, however, has only
been validated in the range of <code class="reqn">1e-5 \le alpha \le 0.5</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector with elements c(k1, k2). k1 is for testing the sample
extremum. k2 is for testing the sample mean
