<h2> Functions to generate and evaluate continued fractions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package includes functions to convert a rational number to its continued fraction form, to convert any defined continued fraction to a numeric value, and to generate estimates of some common irrationals (e, pi, phi) via continued fraction representations. There's also a function which  generates LaTeX code to draw the continued fraction itself.
