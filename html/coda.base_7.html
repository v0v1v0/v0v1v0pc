<h2>The MN blood system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In humans the main blood group systems are the ABO system, the Rh system and
the MN system. The MN blood system is a system of blood antigens also related
to proteins of the red blood cell plasma membrane. The inheritance pattern of the
MN blood system is autosomal with codominance, a type of lack of dominance in
which the heterozygous manifests a phenotype totally distinct from the homozygous.
The possible phenotypical forms are three blood types: type M blood, type
N blood and type MN blood. The frequencies of M, N and MN blood types vary
widely depending on the ethnic population. However, the Hardy-Weinberg
principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will
remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other
evolutionary influences. This implies that, in the long run, it holds that
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\frac{x_{MM}x_{NN}}{x_{MN}} = \frac{1}{4}</code>
</p>
<p>where xM M and xN N are the genotype relative frequencies of MM and NN
homozygotes, respectively, and xM N is the genotype relative frequency
of MN heterozygotes. This principle was named after G.H. Hardy and W.
Weinberg demonstrated it mathematically.
