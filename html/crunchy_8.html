<h2>Alternate UIs for unauthenticated and unauthorized users</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>crunchyServer()</code> and <code>crunchyBody()</code> allow you to protect your app with
Crunch authentication and authorization. Add these UI contents to your
<code>shiny::shinyUI()</code> body to display different content for visitors who are
not authenticated with Crunch (<code>crunchyPublicBody()</code>) or who are
authenticated but not authorized to access your app
(<code>crunchyUnauthorizedBody</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">crunchyPublicBody(...)

crunchyUnauthorizedBody(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>UI elements for your app, to be conditionally rendered</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An empty string; these functions are called for their side effects of
registering the UI elements so that <code>crunchyServer()</code> can render them as
appropriate.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>crunchyBody()</code>; <code>setCrunchyAuthorization()</code> for governing who is
authorized to view your app.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# This is the example from crunchyBody(), adding these alternate bodies:
