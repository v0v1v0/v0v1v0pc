Reports which output types are supported by this Cairo build

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>Cairo.capabilities</code> returns a logical vector describing the
capabilities of this particular Cairo build.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Cairo.capabilities()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>Cairo</code> package provides multiple back-ends, such as images
(PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector graphics (PDF, PostScript, SVG) or displays
(X11, Windows). However, not all systems support all back-ends. The
<code>Cairo.capabilities</code> function returns a logical vector showing
which capabilities are supported in this particular Cairo build.
</p>
<p>Note that the capabilities depend both on the libraries available in
the system as well as the compiled-in modules in cairo graphics.
