<h2>Nodal involvement and acid phosphatase levels in 53 prostate cancer patients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) emerged as the first clinically
useful tumor marker in the 1940s and 1950s. This data set contains the
serum levels of acid phosphatase of 53 patients that were confirmed to
