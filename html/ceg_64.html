<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A stratified staged tree is a staged tree whose supporting event tree is stratified
and all vertices which are in the same stage are also at the same distance of edges
from the root.

<p>Stratified.event.tree. An stratified event tree is an event tree whose set of events that unfold from all situations,
which are at the same distance of edges from the initial situation, are identical.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>situation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>contingency.table</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list of matrices that represent the contigency tables associated with each variable in the event tree.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stage.structure</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list in which each component is a list associated with a variable in the staged tree that has the following data structure:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> $score - numeric. This is the logarithmic form of the marginal likelihood associated with a particular variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $cluster - list whose components are vectors. Each vector represents a stage associated with a particular variable.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><code>stage.probability</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list in which each component is a list associated with a variable in the staged tree.
Each component of this sublist is a vector that represents the probability distribution associated with
a particular stage of the target variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>prior.distribution</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list of matrices. Each matrix is a collection of vectors that correspond t
a prior distribution for each situation associated with a particular variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>posterior.distribution</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>list of matrices. Each matrix is a collection of vectors that correspond t
a prior distribution for each situation associated with a particular variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>model.score</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric. This is the logarithmic form of the marginal likelihood.</p>
