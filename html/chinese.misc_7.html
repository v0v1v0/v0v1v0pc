<h2>Write Texts in CSV into Many TXT/RTF Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function writes texts in a given .csv file into separated .txt/.rtf files with file names added.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">csv2txt(
  csv,
  folder,
  which,
  header = TRUE,
  na_in_csv = c(NA, "", " ", "?", "NA", "999"),
  na_in_txt = " ",
  name_col = NULL,
  ext = "txt"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>csv</code></td>
<td>
<p>a .csv file. One of its columns contains texts to be written.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>folder</code></td>
<td>
<p>a name of a folder that stores the .txt/.rtf files 
created by the function. The folder may 
already exist. If it does not exist, the function will try to create it recursively. If it cannot 
be created, an error will be raised. See <code>dir.create</code>. Note: a name that contains 
no punctuation is preferred.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number: which column 
of the csv file contains texts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>header</code></td>
<td>
<p>should the .csv file be read with its first row as header? This argument is 
passed to <code>read.csv</code>. Default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na_in_csv</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector indicating what content in the .csv file's cells should be 
taken as <code>NA</code>. The default values are "", " ", "?", "NA", "999"; and you can 
specify other values. But whatever you specify, the default values will always be taken 
as <code>NA</code>. If you do not provide a character vector, the default values are used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na_in_txt</code></td>
<td>
<p>a length 1 character specifying what to write into a .txt file if 
a csv cell is <code>NA</code>. The default is " " (a space).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name_col</code></td>
<td>
<p>a length 1 number to indicate which column of your data should be taken 
as filenames. If it is <code>NULL</code> (default), a unique number will be given to each file, 
See Detail. If a cell is taken to be <code>NA</code>, it will be converted to ""; if it is too long, 
only the first 90 characters are used; one or more blanks and punctuations 
will be replaced by " " (a space).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ext</code></td>
<td>
<p>the extension of files to be written. Should be "txt", "rtf" or "". 
If it is not one of the three, it is set to "".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In writing .txt/.rtf files, the function gives each file a unique number as part of its filename. The 
mechanism is as follows: suppose you have 1234 files, as this number has four digits, a 
series of numbers 0001, 0002,...0012,...0300,...1234 are assigned rather 
than 1, 2,...12,...300,...1234. There are several reasons to do this: first, if <code>name_col</code> 
is <code>NULL</code>, this procedure automatically assigns names. Second, the column you 
specify may have duplicate names. Third, even the column does not have duplicate names, 
the process the function modifies the names to make them valid may 
also produce duplicate names. Fourth, numbers with full digits make it easy to sort them 
in any software.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>nothing is returned and .txt/rtf files are written into the folder.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# First, we create a csv file
x1 &lt;- file.path(find.package("base"), "CITATION")
x2 &lt;- file.path(find.package("base"), "DESCRIPTION")

# Now try to write files

wd &lt;- gsub("/$|\\\\$", "", wd)
f &lt;- paste(wd, "x1x2csv", sep="/")
csv2txt(csv = "x1x2csv.csv", folder = f, which = 3, ext = "")
