<h2>Indicates if the time series is complete</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function indicates if the time series is complete, meaning that the time
steps are equally spaced and there are thus no gaps in the time series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">is_complete(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of the <code>CFtime</code> class</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function gives exact results for time series where the nominal
<em>unit of separation</em> between observations in the time series is exact in terms of the
datum unit. As an example, for a datum unit of "days" where the observations
are spaced a fixed number of days apart the result is exact, but if the same
datum unit is used for data that is on a monthly basis, the <em>assessment</em> is
approximate because the number of days per month is variable and dependent on
the calendar (the exception being the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠360_day⁠</code> calendar, where the
assessment is exact). The <em>result</em> is still correct in most cases (including
all CF-compliant data sets that the developers have seen) although there may
be esoteric constructions of CFtime and offsets that trip up this
implementation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>logical. <code>TRUE</code> if the time series is complete, with no gaps;
<code>FALSE</code> otherwise. If no offsets have been added to the CFtime instance,
<code>NA</code> is returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cf &lt;- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "julian", 0:364)
is_complete(cf)
</code></pre>
