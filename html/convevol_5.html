<h3>Description</h3>

<p>calcConvCt Computes Ct-metric scores for putatively convergent tips (or groups of tips)
given a set of user provided phenotypic characters and a time calibrated phylogeny.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calcConvCt(
  phy,
  traits,
  focaltaxa,
  groups = NULL,
  ace = NULL,
  conservative = FALSE,
  VERBOSE = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phy</code></td>
<td>
<p>The time calibrated phylogeny of interest in phylo format</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>traits</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of numeric phenotypic traits with rownames matching tip labels of phy</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>focaltaxa</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of tip labels for the putatively convergent taxa to be compared</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional vector of groups with names matching focaltaxa. Indicates the group identity of all putatively convergent taxa and limits Ct measures to intergroup comparisons only</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ace</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of user supplied ancestral trait values at internal nodes (formatted as "traits" but with node number as rownames)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conservative</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical value indicating whether Dmax.t should be restricted to occurr before the oldest stem lineage of the two groups involved in each pairwise comparison. Stem lineage age for each group is defined as the height of the parent node of the branch subtending the most recent common ancestor of tips within a group. Where groups include a single tip, the parent node of the tip's subtending branch is used. Requires group object to be provided by user.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>VERBOSE</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical value indicating whether model information should be printed during computation</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function incorporates the optimizations introduced by Zelditch et al. (2017), which significantly improve runtimes
</p>
<p>Reconstructions part way along branches are obtained using equation 2 of Felsenstein (1985), following code modified from the phytools (Revell, 2012) function contMap
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of the following components:
</p>
<p>mean a named vector of Ct-metrics averaged from all pairwise comparisons of focaltaxa. If user provided groups, this is based only on comparisons between taxa belonging to different groups.
</p>
<p>Cmat a matrix of Ct-metrics for each pairwise comparison.
</p>
<p>path_df a list of dataframes, one per pairwise comparison of the focal taxa, each containing information from all timepoint measurements of the two putatively convergent lineages. These provide the nodes at which comparisons were drawn, the evolutionary path along which that node fell (i.e., leading to one of two tips), the node height, reconstructed ancestral states at that node for each phenotypic trait, reconstructed ancestral values for each trait along the opposite path, and the phenotypic distance between the two lineages at that point.
</p>
<p>grp.mean a matrix of Ct-metrics summarized for inter-group comparisons, returned only if user defined groups were specified. Provides overall results matching those reported in "mean", results for each unique inter-group comparison, and results averaged with equal weight given to each unique inter-group comparison (i.e., ignoring differences in the number of tips in each group).
</p>
<p>limits a list of tree heights used to constrain Dmax.t calculations for each pairwise comparison in conservative analyses. Only returned if conservative == TRUE.
