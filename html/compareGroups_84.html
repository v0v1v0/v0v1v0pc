<h2>
Descriptives by groups
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs descriptives by groups for several variables. Depending on the nature of these variables, different descriptive statistics are calculated (mean, median, frequencies or K-M probabilities) and different tests are computed as appropriate (t-test, ANOVA, Kruskall-Wallis, Fisher, log-rank, ...).
</p>

<td>
<p>an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class). Right side of ~ must have the terms in an additive way, and left side of ~ must contain the name of the grouping variable or can be left in blank (in this latter case descriptives for whole sample are calculated and no test is performed).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by 'as.data.frame' to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If they are not found in 'data', the variables are taken from 'environment(formula)'.</p>

<p>an optional vector specifying a subset of individuals to be used in the computation process. It is applied to all row-variables. 'subset' and 'selec' are added in the sense of '&amp;' to be applied in every row-variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>
<p>a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. The default is NULL, and that is equivalent to <code>na.pass</code>, which means no action. Value <code>na.exclude</code> can be useful if it is desired to removed all individuals with some NA in any variable.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xext</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame or a matrix with the same rows / individuals contained in <code>X</code>, and maybe with different variables / columns than <code>X</code>. This argument is used by <code>compareGroups.default</code> in the sense that the variables specified in the argument <code>selec</code> are searched in <code>Xext</code> and/or in the <code>.GlobalEnv</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending whether the row-variable is considered as continuous normal-distributed (1), continuous non-normal distributed (2) or categorical (3), the following descriptives and tests are performed: <br>
1- mean, standard deviation and t-test or ANOVA <br>
2- median, 1st and 3rd quartiles (by default), and Kruskall-Wallis test <br>
3- or absolute and relative frequencies and chi-squared or exact Fisher test when the expected frequencies is less than 5 in some cell<br>
Also, a row-variable can be of class 'Surv'. Then the probability of 'event' at a fixed time (set up with 'timemax' argument) is computed and a logrank test is performed.<br></p>
<p>When there are more than 2 groups, it also performs pairwise comparisons adjusting for multiple testing (Tukey when row-variable is normal-distributed and Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method otherwise), and computes p-value for trend. 
The p-value for trend is computed from the Pearson test when row-variable is normal and from the Spearman test when it is continuous non normal. Also, for continuous non normal distributed variables, it is possible to compute the p-value for trend using the Kendall's test (<code>method='kendall'</code> from <code>cor.test</code>) or Cuzick's test (<code>cuzickTest</code>). 
If row-variable is of class 'Surv', the score test is computed from a Cox model where the grouping variable is introduced as an integer variable predictor. 
If the row-variable is categorical, the p-value for trend is computed from Mantel-Haenszel test of trend.
</p>
<p>If there are two groups, the Odds Ratio or Risk Ratio is computed for each row-variable. While, if the response is of class 'Surv' (i.e. time to event) Hazard Ratios are computed. 
When x-variable is a factor, the Odds Ratio and Risk Ratio are computed using <code>oddsratio</code> and <code>riskratio</code>, respectively, from <code>epitools</code> package. While when x-variable is a continuous variable, the Odds Ratio and Risk Ratio are computed under a logistic regression with a canonical link and the log link, respectively. <br></p>
<p>The p-values for Hazard Ratios are computed using the logrank or Wald test under a Cox proportional hazard regression when row-variable is categorical or continuous, respectively. <br></p>
<p>See the vignette for more detailed examples illustrating the use of this function and the methods used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class 'compareGroups'.  <br></p>
<p>'print' returns a table sample size, overall p-values, type of variable ('categorical', 'normal', 'non-normal' or 'Surv') and the subset of individuals selected.  <br></p>
<p>'summary' returns a much more detailed list. Every component of the list is the result for each row-variable, showing frequencies, mean, standard deviations, quartiles or K-M probabilities as appropriate. Also, it shows overall p-values as well as p-trends and pairwise p-values among the groups. <br></p>
<p>'plot' displays, for all the analyzed variables, normality plots (with the Shapiro-Wilks test), barplots or Kaplan-Meier plots depending on whether the row-variable is continuous, categorical or time-to-response, respectevily. Also, bivariate plots can be displayed with stratified by groups boxplots or barplots, setting 'bivar' argument to TRUE.  <br></p>
<p>An update method for 'compareGroups' objects has been implemented and works as usual to change all the arguments of previous analysis. <br></p>
<p>A subset, '[', method has been implemented for 'compareGroups' objects. The subsetting indexes can be either integers (as usual), row-variables names or row-variable labels.       <br></p>
<p>Combine by rows,'rbind', method has been implemented for 'compareGroups' objects. It is useful to distinguish row-variable groups. <br></p>
<p>See examples for further illustration about all previous issues. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>By default, the labels of the variables (row-variables and grouping variable) are displayed in the resulting tables. These labels are taken from the "label" attribute of each variable. And if this attribute is NULL, then the name of the variable is displayed, instead. 
To label non-labeled variables, or to change their labels, specify its "label" atribute directly.<br></p>
<p>There may be no equivalence between the intervals of the OR / HR and p-values. For example, when the response variable is binary and the row-variable is continuous, p-value is based on Mann-Whitney U test or t-test depending on whether row-variable is normal distributed or not, respectively, while the confidence interval is build using the Wald method (log(OR) -/+ 1.96*se). Or when the answer is of class 'Surv', p-value is computed with the logrank test, while confidence intervals are based on the Wald method (log(HR) -/+ 1.96*se). 
Finally, when the response is binary and the row variable is categorical, the p-value is based on the chi-squared or Fisher test when appropriate, while confidence intervals are constructed from the median-unbiased estimation method (see <code>oddsratio</code> function from <code>epitools</code> package). <br></p>
<p>Subjects selection criteria specified in 'selec' and 'subset' arguments are combined using '&amp;' to be applied to every row-variable.<br></p>
<p>Through '...' argument of 'plot' method, some parameters such as figure size, multiple figures in a unique file (only for 'pdf' files), resolution, etc. are controlled. For more information about which arguments can be passed depending on the format type, see <code>pdf</code>, <code>bmp</code>, <code>jpeg</code>, <code>png</code> or <code>tiff</code>.<br></p>
<p>Since version 4.0, date variables are supported. For this kind of variables only method==2 is applied, i.e. non-parametric tests for continuous variables are applied. However, the descriptive statistics (medians and quantiles) are displayed in date format instead of numeric format.
