<h2>Rosenberg-Kim Kinship Terms Partition Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Partitions of 15 kinship terms given by 85 female undergraduates at
Rutgers University who were asked to sort the terms into classes
“on the basis of some aspect of meaning”.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("Kinship82")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A cluster ensemble of 85 hard partitions of the 15 kinship terms.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Rosenberg and Kim (1975) describe an experiment where perceived
similarities of the kinship terms were obtained from six different
“sorting” experiments.  These “original” Rosenberg-Kim
kinship terms data were published in Arabie, Carroll and de Sarbo
(1987), and are also contained in file ‘<span class="file">indclus.data</span>’ in the
shell archive <a href="https://netlib.org/mds/indclus.shar">https://netlib.org/mds/indclus.shar</a>.
</p>
<p>For one of the experiments, partitions of the terms were printed in
Rosenberg (1982).  Comparison with the original data indicates that
the partition data have the “nephew” and “niece” columns
interchanged, which is corrected in the data set at hand.
