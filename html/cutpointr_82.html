<h2>Suicide attempts and DSI sum scores of 532 subjects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various personality and clinical psychological characteristics were assessed
as part of an online-study preventing suicide. To identify persons at risk
for attempting suicide, various demographic and clinical characteristics
were assessed. Depressive Symptom Inventory - Suicidality Subscale
(DSA-SS) sum scores and past suicide attempts from 532 subjects are
included as a demonstration set to calculate optimal cutpoints. Two
additional demographic variables (age, gender) are also included to test
for group differences.
