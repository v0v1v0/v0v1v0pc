<h2>The waste composition in Catalonia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The actual population residing in a municipality of Catalonia is composed by the
census count and the so-called floating population (tourists, seasonal visitors,
hostel students, short-time employees, and the like). Since actual population
combines long and short term residents it is convenient to express it as
equivalent full-time residents. Floating population may be positive if the +
municipality is receiving more short term residents than it is sending elsewhere,
or negative if the opposite holds (expressed as a percentage above –if positive–
or below –if negative–  the census count). The waste data set includes this
information in the variable floating population. Floating population has a
large impact on solid waste generation and thus waste can be used to predict
floating population which is a hard to estimate demographic variable. This
case study was presented in

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Tourists and census population do not generate the same volume of waste and have
different consumption and recycling patterns (waste composition). The Catalan
Statistical Institute (IDESCAT) publishes official floating population data for all
municipalities in Catalonia (Spain) above 5000 census habitants. The composition
of urban solid waste is classified into D = 5 parts:
* x1 : non recyclable (grey waste container in Catalonia),
* x2 : glass (bottles and jars of any colour: green waste container),
* x3 : light containers (plastic packaging, cans and tetra packs: yellow container),
* x4 : paper and cardboard (blue container), and
* x5 : biodegradable waste (brown container).
