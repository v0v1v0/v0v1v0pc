<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a fictional clinical trial, the effectiveness of a new antidepressant
should be examined and depressed patients were randomized to one of four
groups:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A wait list control group that did not receive a medication
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> An inactive placebo group, i.e., a group that received a placebo
(inert substance without proposed clinical effect) pill
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> An active placebo group, i.e., a group that received a placebo that evokes
side effects like mild nausea or a dry mouth
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The antidepressant group, so the target medication of this trial that should
have a clinical impact on the patients' depressive symptoms
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose they underwent outpatient treatment, depressive symptoms were measured
before and after treatment with the Mind over Mood Depression Inventory
(MoM-DI) by Greenberger &amp; Padesky (2015), and if a patient received a pill,
the clinician and the patient did not know, what type of medicaction they
consumed.
</p>
<p>Further, the minimal important difference for an improvement as measured by
this instrument was agreed to be an 8 point decrease. A deterioration can be
assumed if instrument scores increased by 5 points.
</p>
<p>The functional population (i.e., non-depressed individuals) can be expected to
have a mean score of M = 8 points with a standard deviation of SD = 7.
