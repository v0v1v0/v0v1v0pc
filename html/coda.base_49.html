<h2>Hotel posts in social media</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'weibo_hotels' data set aims at comparing the use of Weibo (Facebook
equivalent in China) in hospitality e-marketing between small and medium
accommodation establishments (private hostels, small hotels) and big and
well-established business (such as international hotel chains or large hotels)
in China. The 50 latest posts of the Weibo pages of each hotel (n = 10) are
content-analyzed and coded regarding the count of posts featuring information
on a 4-part composition [facilities, food, events, promotions]. Hotels were
coded as large “L” or small “S” in the hotel size categorical variable.
