<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>GetCDLData</code> function implements the data request in two steps. First, the function sends data requests to the CropScape online server using the <code>GET</code> function
from the <code>httr</code> package. Second, the function reads the requested data into R using the <code>raster</code> function from the <code>raster</code> package. By default, the data
returned from the CropScape are in the raster-based GeoTIFF file format. Users can choose to save the raw GeoTIFF data into their local drives.
</p>
<p>Users should at least specify <code>aoi</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>type</code> to make valid data requests. <code>aoi</code>, or area of interest, refers to the
area to make data request. An <code>aoi</code> can be a state/county defined by a 2-digit/5-digit FIPS code, a box defined by four corner points,
a polygon defined by multiple coordinates, a single point defined by a coordinate, or a custom area defined by an ESRI shapefile.
</p>
<p>If the type of <code>aoi</code> is a box, users should specify <code>aoi</code> as a numeric vector with four elements that represent corner points of the box.
The format of the box should be (minimum x, minimum y, maximum x, maximum y). For example, if latitude/longitude is used, users should specify the <code>aoi</code> as
(Lower longitude, Lower latitude, Higher longitude, Higher latitude). Note that for box type <code>aoi</code>, users can also
use a sf object as the input of <code>aoi</code>. In this case, the <code>GetCDLData</code> will automatically extract bounding box points from the sf object and then make data request. The sf object
must contain the crs information. If the type of <code>aoi</code> is a polygon, users should specify <code>aoi</code> as a
numeric vector with at least 6 elements (corresponding to multiple points). The format is (x1, y2, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn). The polygon can take any shape.
If the type of <code>aoi</code> is a custom area, users
must specify <code>aoi</code> as a URL of a compressed ESRI shapefile. The .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files must all be compressed with no subdirectories in a single ZIP file.
In cases that the compressed shapefile is saved in the local disk, this shapefile needs to be published to a website URL. See more detailed instructions from here:
<a href="https://github.com/cbw1243/CropScapeR">https://github.com/cbw1243/CropScapeR</a>
</p>
<p>The <code>GetCDLData</code> function provides some additional functionalities that might benefit the users. First, it can recognize data requests made in any coordinate system.
The default coordinate system used by the CDL is a projected coordinate system called Albers projection (or Albers equal-area conic projection).
Users can specify an alternative coordinate system, such as latitude/longitude, by changing the <code>crs</code> value. As an exception, this functionality
is unavailable when the requested data type is 's' (a shapefile). This is because the zipped shapefile is directly sent to CropScape, and it cannot
be processed before sending the request. If a shapefile is used, users must ensure that the shapefile has the Albers projection system. Second, the <code>tol_time</code> argument specifies
the upper time limit for making the data request. This is useful particularly when the CropScape server has issues with responding to the data request (e.g., system maintenance).
It is possible that the CropScape server takes a long time before sending back a message saying that the data are not available. The default time limit is 20 seconds.
Third, users can choose to save the raster TIF file in their local disks when requesting the CDL data. This can be done simply by specifying a directory name
in <code>save_path</code>. In this case, <code>GetCDLData</code> will first save the data and then read the saved data into <code>R</code> using the <code>raster</code> function
from the <code>raster</code> package. For example, when letting <code>save_path</code> be 'C:/test.tif', the raster TIF file will be saved at the 'C' disk in the name of
'test.tif'. If <code>save_path</code> is <code>NULL</code> (default), the raster TIF file will not be saved but just read into the <code>R</code> environment through the <code>raster</code> function.
Forth, users can transform the raster data into a data table by letting <code>format</code> = 'table' or a sf object by letting <code>format</code> = 'sf'. The transformation into data table is done by using the
<code>as.data.frame</code> function from the <code>raster</code> package. The returned object would be a data table with the coordinates (first two columns) and
numeric codes of the land cover category (third column). The coordinates are centroids of the grid cells. The transformation into 'sf' is based on functions in the 'sf' package.
</p>
<p>The CDL website provides an EXCEL file that links the numeric codes with the land cover names.
Users can download the EXCEL file from this link <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/docs/cdl_codes_names.xlsx">https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/docs/cdl_codes_names.xlsx</a>.
Alternatively, users can also use <code>data(linkdata)</code> to get the data directly from this package.
Yet, be noted that <code>linkdata</code> saved in this package is not frequently updated.

<p>Mac users might encounter the error of 'SSL certificate expired', and this error can be avoided by skipping the SSL check.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns the requested CDL data for the aoi in a given year. Format of the returned object can be a raster, a data table, or a sf, depending on users' choice.
