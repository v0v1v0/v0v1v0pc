<h2>cnum: Working with Chinese Numerals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This R package provides useful functions to work with Chinese numerals in R,
such as conversion between Chinese numerals and Arabic numerals as well as
detection and extraction of Chinese numerals in character objects and string.
</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>This package supports conversion of numbers with absolute
value not greater than 1e+18. Note that numbers in R are in double
precision that carries approximately 16 significant digits. The conversion
accuracy for numbers beyond this limit is therefore not guaranteed.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Due to technical limitation, R package documentation cannot contain any
non-ASCII characters. Therefore, Chinese characters are represented in
romanized Chinese <em>pinyin</em> in the documentation. Visit the GitHub page
for examples in Chinese.
