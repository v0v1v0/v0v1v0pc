<h2>Arterial pressure data of crossover design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data of a crossover experiment with three treatments to control arterial
pressure: treatment A is a placebo, treatments B and C are 20 and 40 mg doses
of a test drug.
Thus, there were six three-period sequences: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB
and CBA, each one of them was applied to two individuals lasting six
weeks each. Due to ethical reasons, there  was no washout period between
the treatments. In each period, 10 consecutive measurements
of diastolic arterial pressure were taken: 30 and 15 minutes before,
and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 240 minutes after
the administration of the treatment
