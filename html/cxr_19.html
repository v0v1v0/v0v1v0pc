<h2>Competitive ability among pairs of species</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the competitive ability among two species, as defined by Hart et al. (2018). This metric, as others in MCT, is
model-specific; the formulation for a series of Lotka-Volterra-like models is given in table A1 of Hart et al. (2018).
We include in <code>cxr</code> by default the formulation for Beverton-Holt, Ricker, Law-Watkinson, and Lotka-Volterra families.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">competitive_ability(
  cxr_multifit = NULL,
  cxr_sp1 = NULL,
  cxr_sp2 = NULL,
  lambda = NULL,
  pair_matrix = NULL,
  model_family = NULL
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function, as in <code>avg_fitness_diff</code> and <code>niche_overlap</code>, accepts three different parameterizations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A cxr_pm_multifit object, from which competitive ability of a focal species relative to a given competitor
will be computed across all species pairs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> two cxr_pm_fit objects, one for a focal species and one for a competitor.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> explicit lambda and alpha values, as well as the model family from which these parameters were obtained.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the third parameterization is used, the function will try to find a model-specific function
for obtaining the competitive ability, by looking at the 'model_family' parameter.
If this specific function is not found, it will resort to the standard Lotka-Volterra
formulation (lambda - 1 in the numerator term, Hart et al. 2018).
Overall, we strongly suggest that you use the standard formulation ONLY if you are completely confident
that the model from which you obtained your parameters is consistent with it.
Otherwise, you should include your own formulation of competitive ability (see vignette 4).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data frame with variable number of rows and three columns, specifying taxa identity and the competitive ability
of focal species (sp1) relative to the competitor (sp2).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">competitive_ability(lambda = runif(1,1,10),
                              pair_matrix = matrix(runif(4,0,1),nrow = 2),
                              model_family = "BH")
