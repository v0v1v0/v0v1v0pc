<h2>Streamlined organization with project specific custom templates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cabinets makes it easy to create project specific file structure templates
that can be referenced at the start of any R session. Cabinets works by writing
project specific file templates to the .Rprofile file of the default working directory.
Doing so allows the templates to be accessed in new R sessions without having to
redefine them. On first use, users will be prompted for explicit permission to
write to .Rprofile. Permission to write can be revoked at any time by setting the
permission option in the .Rprofile file to FALSE. Due to these explicit permission
requirements, cabinets will only work in interactive R sessions.
