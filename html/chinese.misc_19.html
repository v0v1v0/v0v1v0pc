<p>In a valid text file that saves stop words, each word should occupy a single line. However, 
if any line that contains more than one word and these words are separated by blanks, 
punctuations, numbers, it is also accepted, for the function will try to split them.
Duplicated words will also be automatically removed.
The encoding of a stop words file is auto-detected by the function.
</p>
<p>For stop word list from <code>jiebaR</code>, see <code>jiebaR::STOPPATH</code>.  It contains 
many words that are often removed in analyzing Chinese text.
However, the result returned by <code>make_stoplist</code> is slightly different.
