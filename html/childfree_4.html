<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm">National Survey of Family Growth</a> (NSFG)
regularly collects fertility and other health information from a population-representative sample of adults in the
United States. Between 1973 and 2002, the NSFG was conducted periodically. Starting in 2002, the NSFG transitioned to
continuous data collection, releasing data in multi-year waves (e.g., 2006-2010, 2011-2013). The <code>nsfg()</code> function reads
the raw data from CDC's website, extracts and recodes selected variables useful for studying childfree adults and other family
statuses, then returns either an unweighted data frame, or a weighted design object that can be analyzed using the <code>survey</code>
package.

<p><strong>Notes</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Starting in 2006, "hispanic" was a response option for race, however "hispanic" is not a racial category, but an ethnicity.
When a respondent chose this option, their actual race is unknown.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The NSFG manual explains that "sample sizes for a single year are too small to provide estimates with adequate levels of precision,"
and therefore recommends avoiding analysis of data from single years. Instead, these data are designed to be analyzed by wave using
the provided sampling weights. The <code>nsfg()</code> function provides weights for analysis of single waves, however alternate weights
are available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_combining_data.htm"><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠from the CDC⁠</code></a> for users who wish to combine multiple waves.

</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame or weighted svydesign object containing variables described in the codebook available using <code>vignette("codebooks")</code>
If you are offline, or if the requested data are otherwise unavailable, NULL is returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
unweighted &lt;- nsfg(years = 2017)  #Request unweighted data
if (!is.null(unweighted)) {  #If data was available...
table(unweighted$famstat) / nrow(unweighted)  #Fraction of respondents with each family status
}

weighted &lt;- nsfg(years = 2017, survey = TRUE)  #Request weighted data
if (!is.null(weighted)) {  #If data was available...
survey::svymean(~famstat, weighted, na.rm = TRUE)  #Estimated prevalence of each family status
}

</code></pre>
