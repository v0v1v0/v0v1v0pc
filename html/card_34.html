<h2>Read in Toolbox HRV</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes the output from HRV Toolbox and reads it in for an
individual patient. Unlike card::proc_hrv_matlab, this does not process
or summarize the data, it just reads it the raw analysis. Uses the package
<code>data.table::fread()</code> for reading in data due to size/speed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_hrv_matlab(loc, name)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>loc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Location of the folder that contains all of the patients
that were analyzed by the Main_HRV_Analysis.m function from the
Toolbox</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the patient/ID. There should exist a folder with
the name inside the <code>loc</code> folder. Inside this folder are all the
Toolbox parameters and HRV results in CSV format.
3600 seconds (which is 1 hour)</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data is taken sequentially (sliding windows), and is not processed. It is reported and is likely a large file.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame of HRV summarized by the grouping variable (e.g.
3600 seconds = 1 hour). Also returns an additional column of
percent missing (e.g. 20.0% missing data) by time group.
