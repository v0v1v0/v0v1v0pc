<h2>Climate Change Indicators of Californian Counties</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing observed and projected indicators of climate change related natural hazards for 58 Californian counties. The values are actually the medians of the predicted distribution over spatial measurement points. It is a compiled data set from three sources and that has been aggregated to the county level. The projected data were derived under two different IPCC climate change scenarios (A2, the high emission scenario and B1, the moderate emission scenario). It further contains the county value of the California social vulnerability index.
