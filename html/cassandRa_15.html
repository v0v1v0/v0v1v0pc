<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Based on optimising algorithm described in Larremore, D.B., Clauset, A. &amp; Jacobs, A.Z. (2014).
Efficiently inferring community structure in bipartite networks. Phys. Rev. E - Stat. Nonlinear,
Soft Matter Phys., 90, 1-12
</p>
<p>Initially all species are randomly assigned to groups. Then, one at a time, each species is swapped
into a different group and the likelihood of the model assessed (with SBMLik()).
</p>
<p>The best model of all these swaps is then selected (even if it is worse) and used in the next round of swapping.
</p>
<p>This fits the 'degree-corrected' biSBM mdoel of Larremore et al., which is generally better when there are broad degree distributions
</p>
<p>This is repeated until either n_rounds_max is reached, or the (most commonly), if the best model
in the last 20 is within 0.1 log-likelihood of the best overall (implying it has stopped improving).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing 'LogLik' (the maximum likelihood found) 'SB_H', the group assignments of the host,
'SB_W', the group assignments of the other level, and 'Omega_rs', the interaction probabilities between groups.
