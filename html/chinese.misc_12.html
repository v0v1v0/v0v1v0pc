<h2>Collect Full Filenames from a Mix of Directories and Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The input can be one or more directories, one or more files, or the mixture of the two. 
It will return the full paths of all files in a recursive way, 
and sort them in increasing order. When files are put in 
different areas of your disk, you may need this function to collect them. 
It is essentially a wrapper of <code>list.files</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dir_or_file(..., special = "")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>names of directories and files; if the input is not vector, the function will try to 
coerce it. Relative paths and paths starting with "~/" are also accepted. 
In Windows, both "/"  and double inversed slashes inside filenames are accepted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>special</code></td>
<td>
<p>a length 1 character or regular expression. Only filenames that have this pattern
will be collected. Default value is "" (character with size 0), and is to collect everything.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Failure may occur when obtaining absolute paths, please see <code>normalizePath</code> 
for possible reasons.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a character vector of full filenames with increasing order, and every name is 
unique. If no filename is collected, an error will be raised.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x1 &lt;- find.package("base")
x2 &lt;- find.package("utils")
all_file &lt;- dir_or_file(x1, x2, special = "rds$")
</code></pre>
