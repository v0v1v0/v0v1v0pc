<h2>Sequence of scenarios</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A sequence of scenarios is treated as a single scenario and each scenario
is simulated one after the other. If scenario <code>n</code> in a sequence was simulated,
scenario <code>n+1</code> will start off in the model state where <code>n</code> had ended.
Scenario sequences can be used to e.g. implement changes in model parameters
over time.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>All scenarios in a sequence must fulfill the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> All scenarios must have identical state variables
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <em>output times</em> of all scenarios must represent a continuous time series
without gaps or overlaps
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limitations</h4>

<p>Only simulation of sequences are supported, at the moment.
Effects and effect profiles (EPx values) cannot be derived, yet.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an S4 object of type ScenarioSequence
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># create two scenarios that need to be simulated one after the other
scen1 &lt;- minnow_it %&gt;% set_times(0:3)
scen2 &lt;- minnow_it %&gt;% set_times(3:6) %&gt;% set_param(c(kd=0))

# create a sequence and assign scenarios
sq &lt;- sequence(list(scen1, scen2))

# simulate the sequence

simulate(sq)
