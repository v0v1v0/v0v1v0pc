<h2>Type of drinker</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not a function.
</p>
<p>This is a categorical variable derived by Statistics Canada that uses
various intermediate alcohol variables to categorize individuals into 4
distinct groups:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Regular Drinker
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Occasional Drinker
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Former Drinker
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Never Drinker
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ALCDTYP(ALCDTYP)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ALCDTYP</code></td>
<td>
<p>cchsflow variable name for type of drinker</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This variable is used in CCHS cycles from 2001 to 2007. How it was
derived remained consistent during these years.
</p>
<p>Starting in 2007, Statistics Canada created a derived variable that looked
at drinking type in the last 12 months. This new derived variable did not
distinguish between former and never drinkers. If your research requires you
to differentiate between former and never drinkers, we recommend using
earlier cycles of the CCHS.
