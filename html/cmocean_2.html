<h2>Return a cmocean palette function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produce a palette function for a palette described by the first
paramter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cmocean(
  name, version = getOption("cmocean-version", "2.0"),
  clip = 0, start = clip/2, end = 1 - clip/2,
  direction = 1, alpha = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>

<p>the name of the colormap to return, see Details for possible
values.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>

<p>specific <code>cmocean</code> version you would like to use; one of:
<code>"0.03"</code>, <code>"0.1"</code>, <code>"0.2"</code>, <code>"0.2.1"</code>, <code>"0.2.2"</code>, <code>"0.3"</code>, <code>"1.0"</code>, <code>"1.1"</code>, <code>"1.2"</code>, <code>"2.0"</code>.
Alternatively, you can use <code>options(`cmocean-version` = "...")</code>
to set the desired version as a global option. Explicitly
set argument overrides the global option; the global option
overrides the default of the latest version stored in the
package.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Names of available palettes depend on the version you would
like to use:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>thermal (&gt;= 1.0), Temperature (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential with dark blue representing lower, cooler
values and transitioning through reds to yellow
representing increased warmer values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>haline (&gt;= 1.0), Salinity (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential, and might be used with dark blue representing
lower salinity or fresher water, transitioning through
greens to light yellow representing increased salinity or
saltier water. This colormap is based on matplotlib’s
“YlGnBu”, but was recreated from scratch using the
‘viscm’ tool.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>solar (&gt;= 1.0), PAR (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from dark brown for low values to increasingly
bright yellow to potentially represent an increase in
radiation in the water.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gray (&gt;= 1.0), Gray (&lt; 1.0, inverted)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from black to white, with uniform steps through
perceptual colorspace. This colormap is generic to be used
for any sequential dataset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>oxy (&gt;= 1.0), Oxygen (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential for most of the colormap, representing the
normal range of oxygen saturation in ocean water, and
diverging 80% of the way into the colormap to represent
a state of supersaturation. The bottom 20% of the
colormap is colored reddish to highlight hypoxic or low
oxygen water, but to still print relatively seamlessly
into grayscale in case the red hue is not important for
an application. The top 20% of the colormap, after the
divergence, is colored yellow to highlight the
supersaturated water.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>deep (&gt;= 1.0), Bathymetry (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from light yellow to potentially represent
shallower water through pale green to increasingly dark
blue and purple to represent increasing depth.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>dense (&gt;= 1.0), Density (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential with whitish-blue for low values and
increasing in purple with increasing value, which could
be used to represent an increase in water density.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>algae (&gt;= 1.0), Chlorophyll (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential with whitish-green for low values and
increasing in green with increasing value, which could
be used to represent an increase in chlorophyll in the
water.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>matter (&gt;= 1.0), CDOM (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential with whitish-yellow for low values and
increasing in pink with increasing value, and could be
used to represent an increase in material in the water.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>turbid (&gt;= 1.0), Turbidity (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from light to dark brown and could be used to
represent an increase in sediment in the water.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>speed (&gt;= 1.0), Speed (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from light greenish yellow representing low
values to dark yellowish green representing large values.
This colormap is the positive half of the <code>delta</code>
colormap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>amp (&gt;= 1.0), WaveHeight (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from whitish to dark red and could be used to
represent an increase in wave height values. This
colormap is the positive half of the <code>balance</code>
colormap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>tempo (&gt;= 1.0), WavePeriod (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from whitish to dark teal and could be used to
represent an increase in wave period values. This
colormap is the negative half of the <code>curl</code> colormap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>phase (&gt;= 1.0), Phase (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Circular, spanning all hues at a set lightness value.
This map is intended to be used for properties such as
wave phase and tidal phase which wrap around from 0° to
360° to 0° and should be represented without major
perceptual jumps in the colormap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>balance (&gt;= 1.0), FreeSurface (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diverging with dark blue to off-white to dark red
representing negative to zero to positive values; this
could be used to represent sea surface elevation, with
deviations in the surface elevations as shades of color
away from neutral off-white. In this case, shades of red
have been chosen to represent sea surface elevation above
the reference value (often mean sea level) to connect
with warmer water typically being
associated with an increase in the free surface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>delta (&gt;= 1.0), Velocity (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diverging from darker blues to just off-white through
shades of yellow green and could be used to represent
diverging velocity values around a critical value
(usually zero). This colormap was inspired by Francesca
Samsel's similar colormap, but generated from scratch
using the ‘viscm’ tool.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>curl (&gt;= 1.0), Vorticity (&lt; 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diverging from darker teal to just off-white through
shades of magenta and could be used to represent
diverging vorticity values around a critical value
(usually zero).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ice (&gt;= 1.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from very dark blue (almost black) to very
light blue (almost white). A use for this could be
representations of sea ice.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>rain (&gt;= 2.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sequential from light, dry colors to blue, wet colors,
and could be used to plot amounts of rainfall.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>topo (&gt;= 2.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>topo</code> colormap has two distinct parts: one that
is shades of blue and yellow to represent water depths
(this is the <code>deep</code> colormap) and one that is
shades of browns and greens to represent land elevation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>diff (&gt;= 2.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diverging, with one side shades of blues and one side
shades of browns.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>tarn (&gt;= 2.0)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diverging, with one side dry shades of browns and the
other a range of greens and blues. The positive end of
the colormap is meant to reflect the colors in rain and
thus be a complementary colormap to rain for rain
anomaly (around 0 or some other critical value).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function taking an integer and returning a character vector
with <code>'#RRGGBB'</code> colours. Currently, it does not make
sense to request more than 256 of them.
