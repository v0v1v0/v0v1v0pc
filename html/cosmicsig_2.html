<h2>cosmicsig: A package of mutational signatures from COSMIC (Catalogue
Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer)
<a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/</a>.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a general introduction to mutational signatures
and the techniques used to discover them, see
Alexandrov et al., 2020 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3">doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3</a>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a data package with 2 main package variables:
<code>signature</code> and <code>etiology</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>signature</code> variable contains the
latest mutational signature profiles released on
<a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/</a> for
3 mutation types:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> SBS (single base substitutions in the context
of preceding and following bases, called SBS96
in this package)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> DBS (doublet base substitutions, called DBS78 in
this package)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ID (small insertions and deletions)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The package variable <code>etiology</code> contains
information on known or hypothesized causes of
mutational signatures. In general, it is better to use
<code>get_etiology</code>.
</p>
<p>Earlier releases are available in the
variables COSMIC_<em>version</em>, e.g.
<code>COSMIC_v3.2</code>.
</p>
<p>The profiles of SBSs signatures depend on the
frequencies of trinucleotides in a genome
and profiles of DBS signatures depend on the
frequencies of dinucleotides in a genome.
Therefore COSMIC and this package provide
slightly different signatures for different
reference genomes. COSMIC and this package offer
versions of SBS and DBS signatures for
human GRCh37 (also known as hg19) and GRCh38,
and for mouse and rat.
ID signatures do not take into consideration
differing nucleotide composition between
reference genomes because relating this
to the ID mutational categories would be
extremely complicated.
</p>
<p>Some signatures are due to experimental
or laboratory artifacts. Function
<code>possible_artifacts</code>
returns these.
