<h2>Additive Tree Distances</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Objects representing additive tree distances.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">as.cl_addtree(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an R object representing additive tree distances.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Additive tree distances are object dissimilarities <code class="reqn">d</code> satisfying
the so-called <em>additive tree conditions</em>, also known as
<em>four-point conditions</em> <code class="reqn">d_{ij} + d_{kl} \le \max(d_{ik} +
    d_{jl}, d_{il} + d_{jk})</code> for all quadruples <code class="reqn">i, j, k, l</code>.
Equivalently, for each such quadruple, the largest two values of the
sums <code class="reqn">d_{ij} + d_{kl}</code>, <code class="reqn">d_{ik} + d_{jl}</code>, and <code class="reqn">d_{il} +
    d_{jk}</code> must be equal.
Centroid distances are additive tree distances where the inequalities
in the four-point conditions are strengthened to equalities (such that
all three sums are equal), and can be represented as <code class="reqn">d_{ij} = g_i
    + g_j</code>, i.e., as sums of distances from a “centroid”.
See, e.g., Barthélémy and Guénoche (1991) for more details on additive
tree distances.
</p>
<p><code>as.cl_addtree</code> is a generic function.  Its default method can
handle objects representing ultrametric distances and raw additive
distance matrices.  In addition, there is a method for coercing
objects of class <code>"phylo"</code> from package
<span class="pkg">ape</span>.
</p>
<p>Functions <code>ls_fit_addtree</code> and
<code>ls_fit_centroid</code> can be used to find the additive tree
distance or centroid distance minimizing least squares distance
(Euclidean dissimilarity) to a given dissimilarity object.
</p>
<p>There is a <code>plot</code> method for additive tree distances.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"cl_addtree"</code> containing the additive
tree distances.
