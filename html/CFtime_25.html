<h2>Create a factor for a CFtime instance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Method for <code>base::cut()</code> applied to CFtime objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'CFtime'
cut(x, breaks, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of CFtime.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string of a factor period (see <code>CFfactor()</code> for a
description), or a character vector of timestamps that conform to the
calendar of <code>x</code>, with a length of at least 2. Timestamps must be given in
ISO8601 format, e.g. "2024-04-10 21:31:43".</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When <code>breaks</code> is one of <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠"year", "season", "quarter", "month", "dekad", "day"⁠</code> a factor is generated like by <code>CFfactor()</code>.
</p>
<p>When <code>breaks</code> is a vector of character timestamps a factor is produced with a
level for every interval between timestamps. The last timestamp, therefore,
is only used to close the interval started by the pen-ultimate timestamp -
use a distant timestamp (e.g. <code>range(x)[2]</code>) to ensure that all offsets to
the end of the CFtime time series are included, if so desired. The last
timestamp will become the upper bound in the CFtime instance that is returned
as an attribute to this function so a sensible value for the last timestamp
is advisable. The earliest timestamp cannot be earlier than the origin of the
datum of <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>This method works similar to <code>base::cut.POSIXt()</code> but there are some
differences in the arguments: for <code>breaks</code> the set of options is different
and no preceding integer is allowed, <code>labels</code> are always assigned using
values of <code>breaks</code>, and the interval is always left-closed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A factor with levels according to the <code>breaks</code> argument, with
attributes 'period', 'epoch' and 'CFtime'. When <code>breaks</code> is a factor
period, attribute 'period' has that value, otherwise it is '"day"'. When
<code>breaks</code> is a character vector of timestamps, attribute 'CFtime' holds an
instance of CFtime that has the same definition as <code>x</code>, but with (ordered)
offsets generated from the <code>breaks</code>. Attribute 'epoch' is always -1.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>CFfactor()</code> produces a factor for several fixed periods, including
for epochs.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- CFtime("days since 2021-01-01", "365_day", 0:729)
breaks &lt;- c("2022-02-01", "2021-12-01", "2023-01-01")
cut(x, breaks)
</code></pre>
