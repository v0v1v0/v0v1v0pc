<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From Martinez et al. (2016): "When the number of turning points in the two
time series that are being compared is not the same,
we recommend choosing the pairs of turning points, i.e.
peak–peak and trough–trough, in the following way:
take the first peak of the first time series, then
compute the chronological difference with each one
of the peaks of the second time series and choose
the peak in this time series that leaves the smallest
algebraic difference. Now, consider the second peak
of the first time series and compute the differences
with all the peaks of the second one but the peaks
that precedes the one chosen in the previous step.
Take from the second time series that for which the
difference is the smallest. This procedure for pairing
peaks is repeated until either all the peaks in the first
time series have been considered or all the peaks in the
second series have been exhausted."
