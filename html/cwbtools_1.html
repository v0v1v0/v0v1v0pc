<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools to Create, Modify and Manage CWB Corpora.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://cwb.sourceforge.io/"><em>Corpus Workbench</em></a> (CWB) offers
a classic approach for working with large, linguistically and structurally
annotated corpora. Its design ensures memory efficiency and makes running
queries fast (Evert and Hardie 2011). Technically, indexing and compressing
corpora as suggested by Witten et al. (1999) is the approach implemented by
the CWB (Christ 1994).
</p>
<p>The C implementation of the CWB is mature and efficient. However, the
convenience and flexibility of traditional CWB command line tools is limited.
These tools are not portable across platforms, inhibiting the ideal of
reproducible research.
</p>
<p>The 'cwbtools' package combines portable pure R tools to create indexed
corpus files and convenience wrappers for the original C implementation of
CWB as exposed by the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB">RcppCWB</a> package.
Additional functionality to add and modify annotations of corpora from within
R makes working with CWB indexed corpora much more flexible. "Pure R" workflows
to enrich corpora with annotations using standard NLP tools or generated
manually can be implemented seamlessly and conveniently.
</p>
<p>The <em>cwbtools</em> package is a companion of the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB">RcppCWB</a> and the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polmineR">polmineR</a> package and is a
building block of an infrastructure to support the combination of
quantitative and qualitative approaches when working with textual data.
