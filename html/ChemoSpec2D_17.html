<h2>Made Up 2D NMR-Like Data Sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Made Up Data that resemble simple, HSQC-like 2D NMR data sets.  Lean, low resolution
and designed primarily to check graphics and test functions. <span class="pkg">As this is made up
data, there is no underlying tri-linear structure and therefore one should NOT try to interpret
the output of <code>miaSpectra2D</code> or <code>pfacSpectra2D</code> run on this data</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>MUD1</code> is intended to test and demonstrate data reduction functions.  The HSQC-like data
is derived from the 1H and 13C spectra of 3-methyl-1-butanol and the corresponding ethyl ether,
idealized slightly for simplicity. There are 10 spectra.  Sample 1 is the alcohol; samples 2-5 are
the alcohol with local shifts (specifically, two peaks have been shifted +/- one data point).
Samples 6-10 are the ether, treated in a similar fashion.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>MUD2</code> is intended to test and demonstrate alignment algorithms.  The HSQC-like data
is derived from the 1H and 13C spectra of 3-methyl-1-butanol, idealized slightly for
simplicity. There are 10 spectra.  The first one is "correct" and the other samples have global shifts on one
or both dimensions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data are stored as a <code>Spectra2D</code> object.
