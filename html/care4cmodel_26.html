<h2>setup_risk_events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Low-level function for setting up a risk matrix for a simulation run.
Available for users who want to build simulation runs out of single elements.
Regular users are recommended to use the function
<code>simulate_single_concept</code> for running a simulation with one
single command (where this function is internally used).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">setup_risk_events(time_span, avg_event_strength = 1, area_risks)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_span</code></td>
<td>
<p>Simulation time span to be covered (integer)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avg_event_strength</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number which indicates the average strength of a
damage event in the simulation. Default is 1 which means that the survival
probabilities as defined in the silvicultural concept of interest are
applied exactly as they are. A value of 2 would mean that one damage event
would have the same effect as would two subsequent events with normal
strength. A value of 0 would trigger no damage events at all.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area_risks</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of subphase-wise baseline damage risks, contained in
the list made with <code>setup_parms</code> under the name <code>risk</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function uses exponentially distributed random numbers (with expectation
= 1) for simulating the strenghth of damaging events. Such kind of
distribution where small events are much more frequent than strong ones is a
realistic assumption for forest damages. Such a random number is drawn for
each simulation point in time. The actual damage strength (i.e. relative area
loss) for a given subphase is then calculated as follows:<br><code>rel_area_loss = 1 - ((1 - x) ^ avg_event_strength) ^ event_strength</code>,
<br>
where<br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>x: The baseline area loss risk of a given stand development
subphase as resulting from the silvicultural concept definition of
interest
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>avg_event_strength: The user defined overall average event
strenghth
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>event_strength: Exponentially distributed random number with
expectation 1, indicating the damage event strength in a given year
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix where each row is a point in simulation time, and each
column represents a subphase of the silvicultural concept of interest (in
increasing order). Each matrix element describes the relative area loss
that will happen at a given time to a given subphase.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  parms &lt;- setup_parms(pine_no_thinning_and_clearcut_1)
  setup_risk_events(time_span = 200,
                    avg_event_strength = 3,
                    area_risks = parms$risk)
