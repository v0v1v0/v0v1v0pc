<h2>Test for decrease in mean or minimum individual</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This test is used when determining if a new process or
manufacturing location produces material properties that are
"equivalent" to an existing dataset, and hence the existing
basis values are applicable to the new dataset. This test is also
sometimes used for determining if a new batch of material is acceptable.
This function determines thresholds based on both minimum
individual and mean, and optionally evaluates a sample against those
thresholds. The joint distribution between the sample mean
and sample minimum is used to generate these thresholds.
When there is no true difference between the existing ("qualification")
and the new population from which the sample is obtained, there is a
probability of <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> of falsely concluding that there is a
difference in mean or variance. It is assumed that both the original
and new populations are normally distributed.
According to Vangel (2002), this test provides improved power compared
with a test of mean and standard deviation.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used to
determine acceptance limits for a sample mean and sample minimum.
These acceptance limits are often used to set acceptance limits for
material strength for each lot of material, or each new manufacturing
site. When a sample meets the criteria that its mean and its minimum are
both greater than these limits, then one may accept the lot of material
or the new manufacturing site.
</p>
<p>This procedure is used to ensure that the strength of material processed
at a second site, or made with a new batch of material are not degraded
relative to the data originally used to determine basis values for the
material. For more information about the use of this procedure, see
CMH-17-1G or PS-ACE 100-2002-006.
</p>
<p>There are several optional arguments to this function. However, you can't
omit all of the optional arguments. You must supply either
<code>data_sample</code> or <code>n_sample</code>, but not both. You must also supply
either <code>data_qual</code> (and <code>df_qual</code> if <code>data_qual</code> is a
variable name and not a vector) or both <code>mean_qual</code> and <code>sd_qual</code>,
but if you supply <code>data_qual</code> (and possibly <code>df_qual</code>) you should
not supply either <code>mean_qual</code> or <code>sd_qual</code> (and visa-versa). This
function will issue a warning or error if you violate any of these rules.
</p>
<p>If <code>modcv</code> is TRUE, the standard deviation used to calculate the
thresholds will be replaced with a standard deviation calculated
using the Modified Coefficient of Variation (CV) approach.
The Modified CV approach is a way of adding extra variance to the
qualification data in the case that the qualification data has less
variance than expected, which sometimes occurs when qualification testing
is performed in a short period of time.
Using the Modified CV approach, the standard deviation is calculated by
multiplying <code>CV_star * mean_qual</code> where <code>mean_qual</code> is either the
value supplied or the value calculated by <code>mean(data_qual)</code> and
<code class="reqn">CV*</code> is the value computed by <code>calc_cv_star()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>
