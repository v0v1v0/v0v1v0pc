<h2>crosstalkr: A package for the identification of functionally relevant subnetworks from high-dimensional omics data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>crosstalkr provides a key user function, <code>compute_crosstalk</code> as well
as several additional functions that assist in setup and visualization (under development).
</p>


<h3>crosstalkr functions</h3>

<p><code>compute_crosstalk</code> calculates affinity scores of all proteins in a network
relative to user-provided seed proteins. Users can use the human interactome or
provide a network represented as an igraph object.
</p>
<p><code>sparseRWR</code> performs random walk with restarts on a sparse matrix.
Compared to dense matrix implementations, this should be extremely fast.
</p>
<p><code>bootstrap_null</code> Generates a null distribution based on n calls to
<code>sparseRWR</code>
</p>
<p><code>setup_init</code> manages download and storage of interactome data to
speed up future analysis
</p>
<p><code>plot_ct</code> allows users to visualize the subnetwork identified in
<code>compute_crosstalk</code>. This function relies on the ggraph framework.
Users are encouraged to use ggraph or other network visualization packages for
more customized figures.
</p>
<p><code>crosstalk_subgraph</code> converts the output of <code>compute_crosstalk</code> to a
tidygraph object containing only the identified nodes and their connections to the
user-provided seed_proteins. This function also adds degree, degree_rank, and
seed_label as attributes to the identified subgraph to assist in plotting.
