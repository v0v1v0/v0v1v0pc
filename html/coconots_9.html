<h2>
Concolution-closed Models for Time Series
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to analyse time series consisting of low counts are provided. The 
focus in the current version is on practical models that can  capture first 
and higher-order dependence based on the work of Joe (1996). Both equidispersed 
and overdispersed marginal distributions of data can be modelled. Regression 
effects can be included. Fast and efficient procedures for likelihood based 
inference and probabilistic forecasting are provided as well as useful tools 
for model validation and diagnostics. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package allows simulation of convolution-closed count time series models with the <code>cocoSim</code>
function. Model fitting is performed with the <code>cocoReg</code> routine. By passing a cocoReg-type object,
the S3 method <code>predict</code> computes the one-step ahead forecasting distribution. <code>cocoBoot</code>, <code>cocoPit</code>,
<code>cocoScore</code>, and <code>cocoResid</code> provide routines for model assessment.
The main usage of the package is illustrated within the cocoReg function chapter. For more details
and examples of the functions see the respective sections within this vignette. 
</p>
<p>By default, our functions make use of an RCPP implementation. However, users
with a running Julia installation can choose to call Julia in the background
to run their functions by specifiying it in the R function input. This option
is particularly useful for the regression (<code>cocoReg</code>), where a complex likelihood function
must be numerically evaluated to obtain parameter estimates. By leveraging
Julia's automatic differentiation capabilities,
our functions can take advantage of numerical gradients,
leading to increased numerical stability and faster convergence.
</p>
<p>As we find both, the Julia and RCPP
implementations produce qualitatively similar results in all our tests, we have decided to use the RCPP implementation as
the default option to make our package accessible to non-Julia users.
