<h2>corlink: Record linkage, Incorporating Imputation for Missing Agreement Patterns, and Modeling correlation patterns between fields</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A matrix of agreement patterns and counts for record pairs is the input for the procedure.  An EM algorithm is used to impute plausible values for missing record pairs.  A second EM algorithm, incorporating possible correlations between per-field agreement, is used to estimate posterior probabilites that each pair is a true match - i.e. constitutes the same individual.
