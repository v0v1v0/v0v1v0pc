<h2>Find conflicts amongst a set of packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>conflict_scout()</code> is the workhorse behind the conflicted package. You can
call it directly yourself if you want to see all conflicts before hitting
them in practice.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">conflict_scout(pkgs = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pkgs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set of packages for which to report conflicts. If <code>NULL</code>,
the default, will report conflicts for all loaded packages</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list of character vectors. The names are functions and
the values are the packages where they appear. If there is only a single
package listed, it means that an automated disambiguation has selected
that function.
</p>
<p>A user friendly print method displays the result as bulleted list.
