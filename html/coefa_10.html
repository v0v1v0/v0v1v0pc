<h2>Trimming factor loading matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The original factor loading matrices after removing nulls will be trimmed through
this function.At the end all the matrices only have two elements,0 or 1.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coefa_tflm(x,methodE=c("s","ls"),cutoff=c(0.3,0.4,0.5))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of multiple original factor loading matrices included without
NA.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>methodE</code></td>
<td>
<p>The methods for trimming multiple factor loading matrices from
the original study."s" and "ls" are two methods of trimming the original factor
loading matrix, which are widely used in coefa studies.The s = Shafer’s(2005)
method; ls = the Loeber and Schmaling’s method(1985).</p>

<td>
<p>The Criteria for trimming factor loadings matrices. When greater
than the cutoff value, a factor loading is assigned as 1; otherwise, it
assigned as 0. And the cutoff value can be given as 0.3, or 0.4, or 0.5.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is mainly used to discard the intensity information of
the original factor loading matrices and to retain the direction information
which make it into binary data.
</p>
<p>During the coefa trimming process,the strength information of the factor
loading matrices are given up,and the direction information is preserved.
"s" and "ls" are two different methods in the coefa study.
</p>
<p>If method="s", the factor loading matrices will be trimmed using the
Shafer's(2005)method, that is, only the highest salient loadings of each variable
in each factor are retained. If method="ls", the factor loading matrices will
be trimmed using the Loeber and Schmaling's (1985) method,all insignificant
factor loadings will be valued as 0.
</p>
<p>Cutoff is just some fixed criterion for trimming the factor loading matrix.
For example:if cutoff=0.3,elements in the factor loading matrix greater
than 0.3 will be given the value of 1,and elements less than 0.3 will be
replaced with 0.
