<h2>
cna: A Package for Causal Modeling with Coincidence Analysis
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><dfn>Coincidence Analysis</dfn> (CNA) is a configurational comparative method of causal data analysis that was first introduced for crisp-set (i.e. binary) data in Baumgartner (2009a, 2009b, 2013) and generalized for multi-value and fuzzy-set data in Baumgartner and Ambuehl (2020). The <span class="pkg">cna</span> package implements the method's latest stage of development. 
</p>
<p>CNA infers causal structures as defined by modern variants of the so-called <em>INUS-theory</em> (Mackie 1974; Grasshoff and May 2001; Baumgartner and Falk 2023) from empirical data. The INUS-theory is a type-level difference-making theory that spells out causation in terms of redundancy-free Boolean dependency structures. It is optimally suited for the anaylsis of causal structures with the following features: <em>conjunctivity</em>—causes are arranged in complex bundles 
that only become operative when all of their components are properly co-instantiated, each of which in isolation is ineffective or leads to different outcomes—and <em>disjunctivity</em>—effects can be brought about along alternative causal routes such that, when suppressing one route, the effect may still be produced via another one. 
</p>
<p>Causal structures featuring conjunctivity and disjunctivity pose challenges for 
methods of causal data analysis. As many theories of causation (other than the INUS-theory) entail that it is necessary (though not sufficient) for X to be a cause of Y that there be some kind of dependence (e.g. probabilistic or counterfactual) between X and Y, standard methods (e.g. Spirtes et al. 2000) infer that X is <em>not</em> a cause of Y if X and Y are <em>not</em> pairwise dependent. 
Howeover, there often are no dependencies between an individual component X of a conjunctive cause and the corresponding effect Y (for concrete examples see  the package vignette (accessed from R by typing <code>vignette("cna")</code>). In the absence of pairwise dependencies, X can only be identified as a cause of Y if it is embedded in a complex Boolean structure over many factors and that structure is fitted to the data as a whole. But the space of Boolean functions over even a handful of factors is vast. So, a method for INUS-discovery must find ways to efficiently navigate in that vast space of possibilities. That is the purpose of CNA. 
</p>
<p>CNA is not the only method for the discovery of INUS structures. Other methods that can be used for that purpose are Logic Regression (Ruczinski et al. 2003, Kooperberg and Ruczinski 2005), which is implemented in the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=LogicReg"><span class="pkg">LogicReg</span></a>, and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (Ragin 1987; 2008; Cronqvist and Berg-Schlosser 2009), whose most powerful implementations are provided by the R packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=QCApro"><span class="pkg">QCApro</span></a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=QCA"><span class="pkg">QCA</span></a>. But CNA is the only method of its kind that can process data generated by causal structures with more than one outcome and, hence, can analyze common-cause and causal chain structures as well as causal cycles and feedbacks. Moreover, unlike the models produced by Logic Regression or Qualitative Comparative Analysis, CNA's models are guaranteed to be redundancy-free, which makes them directly causally interpretable in terms of the INUS-theory; and CNA is more successful than any other method at exhaustively uncovering all INUS models that fit the data equally well. For comparisons of CNA with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Logic Regression see (Baumgartner and Ambuehl 2020; Swiatczak 2022) and (Baumgartner and Falk 2023), respectively.
</p>
<p>There exist three additional R packages for data analysis with CNA: <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=causalHyperGraph"><span class="pkg">causalHyperGraph</span></a>, which visualizes CNA models as causal graphs, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cnaOpt"><span class="pkg">cnaOpt</span></a>, which systematizes the search for optimally fitting CNA models, and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frscore"><span class="pkg">frscore</span></a>, which automatizes robustness scoring of CNA models.
