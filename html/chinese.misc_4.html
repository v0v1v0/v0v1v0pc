<h2>Miscellaneous Tools for Chinese Text Mining and More</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package aims to help accomplish the basic tasks of Chinese text mining 
in a more efficient way. The manual in Chinese is 
in <a href="https://github.com/githubwwwjjj/chinese.misc">https://github.com/githubwwwjjj/chinese.misc</a>.
Compared with other packages and functions, the package puts more weight 
on the following three points:
(1) It helps save users' time.
(2) It helps decrease errors (it tolerates and corrects input errors, if it can;  
and if it cannot, it gives meaningful error messages).
(3) Although the functions in this package depend on <span class="pkg">tm</span> and 
<span class="pkg">stringi</span>, several steps and the values of arguments have been 
specially set to facilitate processing Chinese text.
For example, <code>corp_or_dtm</code> creates corpus or 
document term matrix, users only need to input folder names or file names, and the function 
will automatically detect file encoding, segment terms, modify texts, 
remove stop words. 
<code>txt2csv</code> and <code>csv2txt</code> help convert the format of texts and do some data 
cleaning. And there are some functions for object class assertion and coercion.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">require(tm)
# Since no Chinese character is allowed, here we 
# use English instead.
# Make a document term matrix in 1 step, few arguments have 
# to be modified by the user.
x &lt;- c(
  "Hello, what do you want to drink?", 
  "drink a bottle of milk", 
  "drink a cup of coffee", 
  "drink some water", 
  "hello, drink a cup of coffee")
dtm &lt;- corp_or_dtm(x, from = "v", type = "dtm")
# Coerce list containing data frames and other lists
df &lt;- data.frame(matrix(c(66, 77, NA, 99), nr = 2))
l &lt;- list(a = 1:4, b = factor(c(10, 20, NA, 30)), c = c('x', 'y', NA, 'z'), d = df)
l2 &lt;- list(l, l, cha = c('a', 'b', 'c'))
