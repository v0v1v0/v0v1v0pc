<h2>Joint probabilities, n=14, symmetric case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Joint probabilities of the number C of crossings
(0, ... 13) and the longest run L (1, ..., 14) in a
series of n=14 independent Bernoulli observations for the
symmetric case (success probability 0.5). The probabilities
are stored in the "times" representations, multiplied by
<code class="reqn">2^{14-1}=8192</code> and are integers in the symmetric
case. Only the joint distributions for n=14, 60, 100
and success probabilities 0.5 and 0.6 are included in
the package to avoid excessive storage, but many more
cases may be generated by the function crossrunsymm.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>matrix, 14 rows and 14 columns
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>generated by the function crossrunsymm and
transformed from an Rmpfr array to a matrix
