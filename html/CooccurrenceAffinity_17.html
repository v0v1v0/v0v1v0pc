<h2>Maximum likelihood estimate and intervals of alpha, null expectation and p-value of a 2x2 table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the maximum likelihood estimate and other quantities computed in AlphInts(),
for the log-odds parameter alpha in the Extended Hypergeometric distribution with fixed margins (mA,mB) and
table-total N, which is the "log-affinity" index of co-occurrence championed in a paper by Mainali et al. (2022) as an index of co-occurrence-based similarity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ML.Alpha(
  x,
  marg,
  bound = TRUE,
  scal = log(2 * marg[3]^2),
  lev = 0.95,
  pvalType = "Blaker"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer co-occurrence count that should properly fall within the closed interval [max(0,mA+mB-N), min(mA,mB)]</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marg</code></td>
<td>
<p>a 3-entry integer vector (mA,mB,N) consisting of the first row and column totals and the table total for a 2x2 contingency table</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bound</code></td>
<td>
<p>a boolean parameter which when TRUE replaces the MLE of "+/-Infinity", applicable when x is respectively at the upper extreme min(mA,mB)
or the lower extreme max(mA+mB-N,0) of its possible range, by a finite value with absolute value upper-bounding the value of
MLEs attainable for values of x not equal to its extremes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scal</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer parameter (default 2*N^2, capped at 10 within the function) that should be 2 or greater</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lev</code></td>
<td>
<p>a confidence level, generally somewhere from 0.8 to 0.95  (default 0.95)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pvalType</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string telling what kind of p-value to calculate. ‘Blaker’ or “midP’.
If ‘pvalType=Blaker” (the default value), the p-value is calculated according to "Acceptability" function of Blaker (2000).
If ‘pvalType=midP’, the p-value is calculated using the same idea as the midP confidence interval.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the maximum likelihood estimate of the log-odds paramater alpha within the Extended Hypergeometric distribition (Harkness 1965)
based on the count x and fixed table margins (mA,mB) and total N, which is the "affinity" index of co-occurrence championed in the paper of Mainali et al. (2022)
as an index of cooccurrence-based similarity, along with the intervals computed in AlphInts, called CI.CP, CI.Balker, CI.midQ and CI.midP.
The boolean "bound" parameter is an option to prevent the intervals containing alpha-estimates to extend to plus or minus infinity, based on a Bayesian argument. T
he bound substituted for the Infinite endpoints is provably larger than the largest value the MLE can take whenever x avoids the enpoints max(mA+mB-N,0) and min(mA,mB)
of its logical range. The recommended confidence interval for alpha is CI.Blaker if a reliably conservative (over-large) coverage probability is desired, and CI.midP otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns maximum likelihood estimate of alpha, the interval-endpoints of alpha values for which x is a median,
and four confidence intervals for alpha, described in detail under documentation for AlphInts().
In addition there are two output list-components for the null-distribution expected co-occurrence count and the p-value
for the test of the null hypothesis alpha=0, calculated as in AlphInts.
