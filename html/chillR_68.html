<h2>Plot daily climate metric accumulation throughout the year (2)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a plot of the accumulation of a climate metric
throughout the year. Its standard output are the mean daily accumulation and
the standard deviation. It is also possible to add one or several so-called
focusyears to add the daily accumulation during these years to the plots.
Plots can be produced in R or directly exported as .png files.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">make_daily_chill_plot2(
  daily,
  metrics = NA,
  startdate = 1,
  enddate = 366,
  useyears = NA,
  metriclabels = NA,
  focusyears = "none",
  cumulative = FALSE,
  fix_leap = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>daily</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object generated with the daily_chill
function, which can calculate several standard chilling metrics or be
supplied with user-written temperature models. Since the format for the
input file must meet certain requirements, I recommend that you follow the
steps shown in the example below to prepare it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metrics</code></td>
<td>
<p>list of the metrics to be evaluated. This defaults to NA, in
which case the function makes a guess on what metrics you want to
calculated. This is done by choosing all column headers that are not
required for a daily_chill object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>startdate</code></td>
<td>
<p>the first day of the season for which the metrics are to be
summarized (as a Julian date = day of the year)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>enddate</code></td>
<td>
<p>the last day of the season for which the metrics are to be
summarized (as a Julian date = day of the year)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useyears</code></td>
<td>
<p>if only certain years are to be used, these can be provided
here as a numeric vector. Defaults to NA, which means all years in the
daily_chill object are used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metriclabels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector with labels for each metric to be
analyzed. Defaults to NA, which means that the strings passed as metrics
will be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>focusyears</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector containing the years that are to be
highlighted in the plot. Years for which no data are available are
automatically removed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cumulative</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean argument (TRUE or FALSE) indicating whether the
climate metric should be shown as daily accumulation rates or as cumulative
accumulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fix_leap</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean parameter indicating whether the anomaly that can
originate when leaf years are present in the data should be smoothed by
interpolating between Dec 30 and Jan 1 in leap years.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Plots daily accumulation of climatic metrics, such as winter chill, as daily
accumulation rates or as cumulative accumulation. A legend is only added,
when focusyears are also shown. Otherwise the plot is reasonably
self-explanatory.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the function is a side effect - plots of daily
climate metric accumulation. However, all the data used for making the plots
is returned as a list containing an element for each metric, which consists
of a data.table with the daily means, standard deviation and daily values
for all focusyears.
