<h2>Feature: Population Merge</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Backwards in time, this feature merges one population into another.
Forwards in time, this corresponds to a speciation event.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">feat_pop_merge(time, pop_source, pop_target, locus_group = "all")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The time at which the merge occurs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_source</code></td>
<td>
<p>The population from which all lines are moved.
This is the newly created population in the speciation event.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_target</code></td>
<td>
<p>The population to which the lines are moved. This is
the population in which the speciation event occurs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>locus_group</code></td>
<td>
<p>The loci for which this features is used. Can either be
<code>"all"</code> (default), in which case the feature is used for simulating
all loci, or a numeric vector. In the latter case, the feature is only
used for the loci added in <code>locus_</code> commands  with the corresponding
index starting from 1 in order in which the commands where added to the
model. For example, if a model has
<code>locus_single(10) + locus_averaged(10, 11) + locus_single(12)</code> and
this argument is <code>c(2, 3)</code>, than the feature is used for all but
the first locus (that is locus 2 - 12).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In addition to the merge, the growth rate of and all migration rates from
the source population will be set to 0 at the time of the merge to mimic
a speciation event forwards in time. Technically, <code>pop_source</code> is
still present in the model, but not used unless migration to the population
is manually enabled.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The feature, which can be added to a model created with
<code>coal_model</code> using <code>+</code>.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Two population which merge after 0.5 time units:
model &lt;- coal_model(c(25,25), 1) +
  feat_pop_merge(0.5, 2, 1) +
  feat_mutation(5) +
  sumstat_tajimas_d()

# An standard isolation-with-migration model:

  feat_migration(.75, symmetric = TRUE)
