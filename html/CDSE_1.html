<h2>Package providing interface to the 'Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem' API</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>CDSE</code> package for R was developed to allow access to the
'Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem' <a href="https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/">https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/</a>
data and services from R. The 'Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem',
deployed in 2023, offers access to the EO data collection from the Copernicus missions,
with discovery and download capabilities and numerous data processing tools.
In particular, the 'Sentinel Hub' API <a href="https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub.html">https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub.html</a>
provides access to the multi-spectral and multi-temporal big data satellite imagery service,
capable of fully automated, real-time processing and distribution of remote sensing data and related EO products.
Users can use APIs to retrieve satellite data over their AOI and specific time range from
full archives in a matter of seconds. When working on the application of EO where the area
of interest is relatively small compared to the image tiles distributed by Copernicus (100 x 100 km),
it allows to retrieve just the portion of the image of interest rather than downloading the huge tile
image file and processing it locally. The goal of the <code>CDSE</code> package is to provide
easy access to this functionality from R.
</p>
<p>The main functions allow to search the catalog of available imagery from the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,
Sentinel-3, and Sentinel-5 missions, and to process and download the images of an area of interest and
a time range in various formats. Other functions might be added in subsequent releases of the package.
</p>


<h3>API authentication</h3>

<p>Most of the API functions require OAuth2 authentication. The recommended procedure is to obtain
an authentication client object from the <code>GetOAuthClient</code> function, and to pass it as the <code>client</code>
argument to the functions requiring the authentication. For more detailed information, you are
invited to consult the <code>"Before you start"</code> document.
