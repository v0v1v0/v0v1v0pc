<h2>Compute Conditional Value-at-Risk and Value-at-Risk</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute expected shortfall (ES) and Value at Risk (VaR)
from a quantile function, distribution function, random number
generator or probability density function.  ES is also known as
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Virtually any continuous
distribution can be specified.  The functions are vectorised over
the arguments. Some support for GARCH models is provided, as well.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is a huge number of functions for computations with
distributions in core <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> and in contributed packages. Pdf's,
cdf's, quantile functions and random number generators are
covered comprehensively. The coverage of expected shortfall is
more patchy but a large collection of distributions, including
functions for expected shortfall, is provided by
Nadarajah et al. (2013).
Peterson and Carl (2018) and
Dutang et al. (2008) provide packages
covering comprehensively various aspects of risk measurement,
including some functions for expected shortfall.
</p>
<p>Package <span class="pkg">cvar</span> is a small package with, essentially, two main
functions — <code>ES</code> for computing the expected shortfall
and <code>VaR</code> for Value at Risk.  The user specifies the
distribution by supplying one of the functions that define a
continuous distribution—currently this can be a quantile
function (qf), cumulative distribution function (cdf) or
probability density function (pdf). Virtually any continuous
distribution can be specified.
</p>
<p>The functions are vectorised over the parameters of the
distributions, making bulk computations more convenient, for
example for forecasting or model evaluation.
</p>
<p>The name of this package, "cvar", comes from <em>Conditional
Value at Risk</em> (CVaR), which is an alternative term for
expected shortfall.
</p>
<p>We chose to use the standard names <code>ES</code> and <code>VaR</code>,
despite the possibility for name clashes with same named
functions in other packages, rather than invent possibly
difficult to remember alternatives. Just call the functions as
<code>cvar::ES</code> and <code>cvar::VaR</code> if necessary.
</p>
<p>Locations-scale transformations can be specified separately
from the other distribution parameters. This is useful when
such parameters are not provided directly by the distribution
at hand. The use of these parameters often leads to more
efficient computations and better numerical accuracy even if
the distribution has its own parameters for this purpose. Some
of the examples for <code>VaR</code> and <code>ES</code> illustrate this
for the Gaussian distribution.
</p>
<p>Since VaR is a quantile, functions computing it for a given
distribution are convenience functions. <code>VaR</code> exported by
<span class="pkg">cvar</span> could be attractive in certain workflows because of
its vectorised distribution parameters, the location-scale
transformation, and the possibility to compute it from cdf's
when quantile functions are not available.
</p>
<p>Some support for GARCH models is provided, as well. It is
currently under development, see <code>predict.garch1c1</code>
for current functionality.
</p>
<p>In practice, we may need to compute VaR associated with data. The distribution comes
from fitting a model. In the simplest case, we fit a distribution to the data,
assuming that the sample is i.i.d. For example, a normal distribution <code class="reqn">N(\mu,
    \sigma^2)</code> can be fitted using the sample mean and sample variance as estimates of the
unknown parameters <code class="reqn">\mu</code> and <code class="reqn">\sigma^2</code>, see section ‘Examples’. For other
common distributions there are specialised functions to fit their parameters and if
not, general optimisation routines can be used. More soffisticated models may be used,
even time series models such as GARCH and mixture autoregressive models.
