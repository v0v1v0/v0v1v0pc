<h2>Result of fitting the Pareto/NBD model without covariates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Output from fitting the Pareto/NBD model on data without covariates. It constitutes the estimation
result and is returned to the user to use it as input to other methods such as to make
predictions or plot the unconditional expectation.
</p>
<p>Inherits from clv.fitted.transactions in order to execute all steps required for fitting a model
