<h2>Class "CrossValidate"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A class that contains the results of internal cross-validation (by
multiple splits into training and test sets) of an algorithm that
builds a model to predict a binary outcome.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>Objects should be created by calls to the constructor function,
<code>CrossValidate</code>.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
<code>nIterations</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer; the number of times the
data was split into training and test sets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>trainPercent</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A number between 0 and 1; the fraction
of data used in each training set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>outcome</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A binary factor containing the true outcome
for each sample.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>trainOutcome</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame containing the true
outcomes for each member of the training set.  The value 'NA' is
used for samples that were reserved for testing. Each column is a
different split into training and test sets.</p>
</dd> 
<dt>
<code>trainPredict</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame containing the predicted
outcome from the model for each member of the training set.  The
value 'NA' is used for samples that were reserved for testing.
Each column is a different split into training and test sets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>validOutcome</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame containing the true
outcomes for each member of the test set.  The
value 'NA' is used for samples that were used for training.
Each column is a different split into training and test sets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>validPredict</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame containing the predicted
outcome from the model for each member of the test set.  The
value 'NA' is used for samples that were used for training.
Each column is a different split into training and test sets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>extras</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list, whose length equals the number of
plsits into trainin and test sets.  Each entry contains any
"extra" information collected during the fitting of the model; the
kinds of items stored here depend on the actual classification
algorithm used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt>summary</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>signature(object = "CrossValidate")</code>: Produces
a summary of the performance of the algorithm on both the trinaing
sets and the test sets, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and
positive or negative predictive value.  Specifically, this method
returns an object of the <code>CrossValSummary-class</code>.
