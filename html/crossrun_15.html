<h2>Joint probabilities, n=14, success probability 0.6</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The joint probabilities of the number C og crossings
(0, ... 13) and the longest run L (1, ..., 14) in a
series of n=14 independent Bernoulli observations for
success probability 0.6. The probabilities are stored
in the "times" representations, multiplied by
<code class="reqn">2^{14-1}=8192</code>. Only the joint distributions for
n=14, 60, 100 and success probabilities 0.5 and 0.6 are
included in the package to avoid excessive storage, but
many more cases may be generated by the function crossrunbin.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">joint14.6

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>matrix, 14 rows and 14 columns
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>generated by the function crossrunbin and
transformed from an Rmpfr array to a matrix
