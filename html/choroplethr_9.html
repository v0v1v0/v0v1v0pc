<h2>A data.frame containing geographic metadata about the Congressional Districts of the 116th US Congress</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Column region is how the Census Bureau refers to the geography. Note that this region is a 4-character string,
and so has a leading 0 if necessary. The first two characters are the state FIPS code, and the second two characters
are the district ID. States that only have 1 district (i.e. a representative "at large") have district 00. 
All other states start at 01.
