<h2>Climate aggregation rules</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Climate temporal aggregation rules are provided by the source, and guarantee
data quality given missing information. These rules are included in the
package to make the download and aggregation process easier for the user. The
aggregation is not available for all climate data, and is only available for
information under the tags <code>TSSM_CON</code>, <code>TMN_CON</code>, <code>TMX_CON</code>,
<code>PTPM_CON</code>, and <code>BSHG_CON</code>. Internal functions are provided as a
set of comprehensible rules to aggregate the data for daily, monthly and
annual frequencies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<td>

</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<h3>Methods</h3>
