<h2>Shiny interface to specify network structure and compute bounds</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This launches the Shiny interface in the system's default web browser. The 
results of the computation will be displayed in the browser, but they can 
also be returned to the R session by assigning the result of the function call
to an object. See below for information on what is returned.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">specify_graph()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the button "Exit and return graph object" is clicked, then only the 
graph is returned as an aaa-igraph-package object. 
</p>
<p>If the bounds are computed and the button "Exit and return objects to R" is clicked, 
then a list is returned with the following elements: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>graphres</dt>
<dd>
<p>The graph as drawn and interpreted, an aaa-igraph-package object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>obj</dt>
<dd>
<p>The objective and all necessary supporting information. This object is 
documented in analyze_graph. This can be passed directly to optimize_effect_2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bounds.obs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class 'balkebound' as returned by optimize_effect_2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constraints</dt>
<dd>
<p>Character vector of the specified constraints. NULL if no constraints.</p>
</dd>
<dt>effect</dt>
<dd>
<p>Text describing the causal effect of interest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>boundsFunction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Function that takes parameters (observed probabilities) as arguments, and returns a vector of length 2 for the lower and upper bounds.</p>
</dd>
