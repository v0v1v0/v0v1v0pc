<h2>Comparison of survival curves between two groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various statistical methods for survival analysis in comparing survival curves between two groups, including overall hypothesis tests described in Li et al. (2015), fixed-point tests in Klein et al. (2007), short-term tests, and long-term tests in Logan et al. (2008). Some commonly used descriptive statistics and plots are also included.
