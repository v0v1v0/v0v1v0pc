  AAStar,
  CSVout = NULL,
  Reference = "none",
  MismatchToleranceB = 0.2,
  MismatchToleranceAStar = 0.2
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of the type <code>character</code> containing the name of a csv file that contains the original classification A.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of the type <code>character</code> containing the name of a csv file that contains classification B.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AStar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of the type <code>character</code> containing the name of a csv file that contains the updated version A*.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AB</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of the type <code>character</code> containing the name of a csv file that contains the previous correspondence table A:B.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AAStar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string of the type character containing the name of a csv file that contains the <em>concordance table</em> A:A*, 
which contains the mapping between the codes of the two versions of the classification.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CSVout</code></td>
<td>
<p>The preferred name for the <em>output csv files</em> that will contain the updated correspondence table and 
information about the classifications involved. The valid values are <code>NULL</code> or strings of type <code>character</code>. If 
the selected value is <code>NULL</code>, the default, no output file is produced. If the value is a string, then the output is 
exported into two csv files whose names contain the provided name (see "Value" below).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>The reference classification among A and B. If a classification is the reference to the other, and 
hence <em>hierarchically superior</em> to it, each code of the other classification is expected to be mapped to at most one 
code of the reference classification. The valid values are <code>"none"</code>, <code>"A"</code>, and <code>"B"</code>. If the selected 
value is <code>"A"</code> or <code>"B"</code>, a "Review" flag column is included in the output (see "Explanation of the flags" below).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MismatchToleranceB</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum acceptable proportion of rows in the updated correspondence table which contain no 
code of the target classification B, among those which contain a code of A, of A*, or of both. The default value 
is <code>0.2</code>. The valid values are real numbers in the interval [0, 1].</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>File and file name requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The files that correspond to arguments <code>A</code>,  <code>B</code>, <code>AStar</code>, <code>AB</code>, <code>AAStar</code> must be 
in <em>csv format with comma as delimiter</em>. If full paths are not provided, then these files must be available 
in the working directory. No two filenames provided must be identical.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If any of the two files where the output will be stored is read protected (for instance because it is open 
elsewhere) an error message will be reported and execution will be halted.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Classification table requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The files that correspond to arguments <code>A</code>,  <code>B</code> and <code>AStar</code> must contain at least one column 
and at least two rows. The first column contains the codes of the respective classification. The first row contains 
column headers. The name of the first column is the name of the respective classification (e.g., "CN 2021").
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The classification codes contained in a classification file (expected in its first column as mentioned above) 
must be unique. No two identical codes are allowed in the column.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If any of the files that correspond to arguments <code>A</code>,  <code>B</code> and <code>AStar</code> has additional columns 
the first one of them is considered as containing the labels of the respective classification codes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Correspondence and concordance table requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The files that correspond to arguments <code>AB</code> and <code>AAStar</code> must contain at least two columns and at least 
two rows. The first column of the file that corresponds to <code>AB</code> contains the codes of classification A. The second 
column contains the codes of classification B. Similar requirements apply to the file that corresponds to <code>AAStar</code>. 
The first row of each of these files contains column headers. The names of the first two columns are the names of the 
respective classifications.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The pairs of classification codes contained in the concordance and the correspondence table files (expected in 
their first two columns as mentioned above) must be unique. No two identical pairs of codes are allowed in the first 
two columns.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interdependency requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> At least one code of classification A must appear in both the file of concordance table A:A* and the file of 
correspondence table A:B.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>	At least one code of classification A* must appear in both the file of 
classification A* and the file of 
concordance table A:A*.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>	At least one code of classification B must appear in both the file of classification B and the file of 
correspondence table A:B.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mismatch tolerance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The ratio that is compared with <code>MismatchToleranceB</code> has as numerator the number of rows of the updated 
correspondence table which contain a code for A, for A*, or for both, but no code for B and as denominator the number of 
rows which contain a code for A, for A*, or for both (regardless of whether there is a code for B or not). If the ratio 
exceeds <code>MismatchToleranceB</code> the execution of the function is halted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The ratio that is compared with <code>MismatchToleranceAStar</code> has as numerator the number of rows of the updated 
correspondence table which contain a code for A, for B, or for both, but no code for A* and as denominator the number of 
rows which contain a code for A, for B*, or for both (regardless of whether there is a code 
for A* or not). If the ratio exceeds <code>MismatchToleranceAStar</code> the execution of the function is halted.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the conditions required from the arguments is violated an error message is produced and execution is stopped.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>updateCorrespondenceTable()</code> returns a list with two elements, both of which are data frames.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The first element is the updated correspondence table A*:B augmented with flags "CodeChange", "Review" (if 
applicable), "Redundancy", "NoMatchToAStar", "NoMatchToB", "NoMatchFromAStar", "NoMatchFromB", "LabelChange", and 
with all the additional columns of the <code>A</code>,  <code>B</code>, <code>AStar</code>, <code>AB</code> and <code>AAStar</code> files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The second element contains the names of the original classification A, the target classification B, and the 
updated version A*, as read from the top left-hand side cell of the respective input files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the value of argument <code>CSVout</code> is a string of type <code>character</code>, the elements of the list are 
exported into files of csv format. The name of the file for the first element is the value of argument <code>CSVout</code> 
and the name of the file for the second element is classificationNames_<code>CSVout</code>. For example, if 
<code>CSVout</code> = "updateCorrespondenceTable.csv", the elements of the list are exported into 
"updateCorrespondenceTable.csv" and "classificationNames_updateCorrespondenceTable.csv", respectively.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Explanation of the flags</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "CodeChange" is equal to <code>1</code> if the code of 
A contained in this row maps -in this or any other row of the table- to a different code of A*, and <code>0</code> otherwise. 
The value of "CodeChange" is empty if either the code of A, or the code of A*, or both are missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The "Review" flag is produced only if argument <code>Reference</code> has been set equal to "<code>A</code>" or "<code>B</code>". 
For each row of the updated correspondence table, if <code>Reference</code> = "<code>A</code>" the value of "Review" is equal to 
<code>1</code> if the code of B maps to more than one code of A*, and <code>0</code> otherwise. If <code>Reference</code> = "<code>B</code>" the 
value of "Review" is equal to <code>1</code> if the code of A* maps to more than one code of B, and <code>0</code> otherwise. The value 
of the flag is empty if either the code of A*, or the code of B, or both are missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "Redundancy" is equal to <code>1</code> if the row contains 
a combination of codes of A* and B that also appears in at least one other row of the updated correspondence table. The 
value of the flag is empty if both the code of A* and the code of B are missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "NoMatchToAStar" is equal to <code>1</code> if there is a 
code for A,  for B, or for both, but no code for A*. The value of the flag is <code>0</code> if there are codes for both A and 
A* (regardless of whether there is a code for B or not). Finally, the value of "NoMatchToAStar" is empty if neither A nor B 
have a code in this row.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "NoMatchToB" is equal to <code>1</code> if there is a code 
for A,  for A*, or for both, but no code for B. The value of the flag is <code>0</code> if there are codes for both A and B 
(regardless of whether there is a code for A* or not). Finally, the value of "NoMatchToB" is empty if neither A nor 
A* have a code in this row.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "NoMatchFromAStar" is equal to <code>1</code> if the row 
contains a code of A* that appears in the table of classification A* but not in the concordance table A:A*. The value of 
the flag is <code>0</code> if the row contains a code of A* that appears in both the table of classification 
A* and the concordance table A:A*. Finally, the value of the flag is empty if the row contains no code of A* or if it 
contains a code of A* that appears in the concordance table A:A* but not in the table of classification A*.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "NoMatchFromB" is equal to <code>1</code> if the row 
contains a code of B that appears in the table of classification B but not in the correspondence table A:B. The value of 
the flag is <code>0</code> if the row contains a code of B that appears in both the table of classification B and the 
correspondence table A:B. Finally, the value of the flag is empty if the row contains no code of B or if it contains a code 
of B that appears in the correspondence table A:B but not in the table of classification B.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each row of the updated correspondence table, the value of "LabelChange" is equal to <code>1</code> if the labels of 
the codes of A and A* are different, and <code>0</code> if they are the same. Finally, the value of "LabelChange" is empty if 
either of the labels, or both labels, are missing. Lower and upper case are considered the same, and punctuation characters 
are ignored when comparing code labels.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample datasets included in the package</h3>

<p>Running <code>browseVignettes("correspondenceTables")</code> in the console opens an html page in the user's default browser. 
Selecting HTML from the menu, users can read information about the use of the sample datasets that are included in the 
package.
If they wish to access the csv files with the sample data, users have two options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Option 1: Unpack into any folder of their choice the tar.gz file into which the package has arrived. All sample datasets 
may be found in the "inst/extdata" subfolder of this folder.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Option 2: Go to the "extdata" subfolder of the folder in which the package has been installed in their PC's <code>R</code> 
library. All sample datasets may be found there.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
