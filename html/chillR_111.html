<h2>Make monthly temperature scenario from historic records</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces a list of scenarios containing monthly means for Tmin and Tmax that are representative
of particular years. These scenario are computed by applying linear regression to a
file containing Tmin and Tmax records, and using the regression model to calculate typical
values for the user-specified years.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">temperature_scenario_from_records(
  weather,
  year,
  weather_start = NA,
  weather_end = NA,
  scen_type = "running_mean",
  runn_mean = 15
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weather</code></td>
<td>
<p>daily weather, as produced with the fix_weather
function. Can also be generated by other means, but shouold contain the columns
c("Month","Day","Year","Tmin","Tmax").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>year</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of years, for which the scenario is to be produced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weather_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>start year of the period to be considered in calculating the regression.
Defaults to NA, which means the first year of the record is used as start year.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weather_end</code></td>
<td>
<p>end year of the period to be considered in calculating the regression.
Defaults to NA, which means the last year of the record is used as end year.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scen_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string, either "regression" or "running_mean", specifying how the
scenario should be produced. "regression" computed the scenario based on an assumed linear trend
in the data; "running_mean" uses a running mean function instead, with the length of the
running mean window determined by the runn_mean parameter. The default is a running mean function,
since the assumption of a linear trend often does not hold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>runn_mean</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of vector elements to use for calculating the
running mean; this is reduced, if the time series is not long enough to accommodate the specified
window. Defaults to 15.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function produces outputs that can be used as input for the temperature_generation
function. Sample applications are the use of the temperature_generation function for
making replicate weather records for a given year for risk assessment purposes, or
the generation of a weather scenario that can be compared with other datasets (e.g. climate
scenarios based on the WorldClim dataset refer to a 1951-2000 baseline, so that meaningful
use of such scenarios for local contexts requires consideration of a scenario that corresponds
to temperatures in 1975, the central year of this period).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list of climate scenario objects, consisting of the following elements: 'data' =
a data frame with n_intervals elements containing the absolute temperature information.
'scenario_year' = the year the scenario is representative of, i.e. the specified 'year' parameter.
'reference_year' = NA (because this is an absolute temperature scenarios, not a 
relative one); 'scenario_type' = 'absolute' (because this is an absolute temperature
scenario, not a relative one); 'labels' = 'regression-based scenario'.
