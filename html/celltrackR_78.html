<h2>Decompose Track(s) into Subtracks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a <em>tracks</em> object consisting of all subtracks of 'x'
with 'i' segments (i.e., 'i'+1 positions).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">subtracks(x, i, overlap = i - 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single track or a <code>tracks</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td>
<p>subtrack length. A single integer, lists are not supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of segments in which each subtrack shall overlap
with the previous and next subtrack. The default <code>i - 1</code> returns all
subtracks. Can be negative, which means that space will be left between
subtracks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The output is always a single <em>tracks</em> object, which is
convenient for many common analyses. If subtracks are to be considered separately
for each track, use the function <code>staggered</code> together with
<code>lapply</code>. Subtrack extraction always starts at the first position of the
input track.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>tracks</em> object is returned which contains all the subtracks
of any track in the input <em>tracks</em> object that consist of exactly 'i'
segments and overlap adjacent subtracks in 'overlap' segments.
</p>

from a subset of trackids.
