<h2>
qPCR Experiment for the Amplification of HPRT1 Using the Roche Light Cycler 
1.5
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the DNA binding dye (EvaGreen) (Mao et al. 
2007) was performed in the Roche Light Cycler 1.5 thermo cycler. The 
cycle-dependent increase of the fluorescence was quantified at the 
elongation step (68.5 degrees Celsius).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(C126EG685)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 40 observations on the following 97 variables. The 
first 
column ("Cycles") contains the number of cycles and consecutive columns 
contain the replicates ("A01" to "H12").
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>MLC-2v was amplified in the Roche Light Cycler 1.5. The the change of 
fluorescence was simultaneously monitored for the Hydrolysis probe of 
MLC-2v and EvaGreen. The primer sequences for MLC-2v were taken from 
Roediger et al. (2013). A 10 micro L qPCR reaction was composed of 250 nM 
primer (forward and reverse), qPCR Mix (according to the manufactures 
recommendations), 1 micro L template  (MLC-2v amplification product), 60 nM 
hydrolysis probe probe for MLC-2v. EvaGreen was used at 0.5 x final. The 
amplification was monitored at 68.5 degrees Celsius (elongation step).
