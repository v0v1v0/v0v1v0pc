<h2>Generate NPClassifier classification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to classify compounds with <em>NPClassifier</em>, and put the results in
a data frame containing the pathway, superclass and class for each compound.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NPCTable(compoundData)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compoundData</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the chemical compounds of interest,
usually the compounds found in the sample dataset.
Should include a column named "compound" with common names of
the compounds and a column named "smiles" with SMILES IDs of the compounds.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>NPClassifier</em> (Kim et al. 2021) is a deep-learning tool that automatically
classifies natural products (i.e. phytochemical compounds) into a
hierarchical classification of three levels: pathway, superclass and class.
This classification largely corresponds to the biosynthetic groups/pathways
the compounds are produced in. The <code>NPCTable</code> function
conveniently performs this classification directly in R on the
compounds in <code>compoundData</code>, by accessing the tool
at <a href="https://npclassifier.ucsd.edu/">https://npclassifier.ucsd.edu/</a> and downloading the classifications.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with the NPClassifier classification for each compound
as pathway, superclass and class. Note that compounds may be classified
in more than one group, or no group, at each level of classification.
