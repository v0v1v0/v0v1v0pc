<h2>Smoking pack-years</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a derived variable (pack_years_der) that
measures an individual's smoking pack-years based on various CCHS smoking
variables. This is a popular variable used by researchers to quantify
lifetime exposure to cigarette use.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pack_years_fun(
  SMKDSTY_A,
  DHHGAGE_cont,
  time_quit_smoking,
  SMKG203_cont,
  SMKG207_cont,
  SMK_204,
  SMK_05B,
  SMK_208,
  SMK_05C,
  SMKG01C_cont,
  SMK_01A
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>pack-years is calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette
packs per day (20 cigarettes per pack) by the number of years. Example 1:
a respondent who is a current smoker who smokes 1 package of cigarettes for
the last 10 years has smoked 10 pack-years. Pack-years is also calculated
for former smokers. Example 2: a respondent who started smoking at age
20 years and smoked half a pack of cigarettes until age 40 years smoked for
10 pack-years.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>value for smoking pack-years in the pack_years_der variable
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Using pack_years_fun() to create pack-years values across CCHS cycles
# pack_years_fun() is specified in variable_details.csv along with the CCHS
# variables and cycles included.

# To transform pack_years_der across cycles, use rec_with_table() for each
# CCHS cycle and specify pack_years_der, along with each smoking variable.
# Since time_quit_smoking_der is also a derived 
# variable, you will have to specify the variables that are derived from it.
# Then by using merge_rec_data(), you can combine pack_years_der across
# cycles
