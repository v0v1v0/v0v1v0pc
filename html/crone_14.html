<h2>Load observed structure factors from 1D structure data in workspace.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to load structure factors corresponding to one of the many 1D 
structures available within the <em>crone</em> package. The structure
factors amplitudes have been generated from calculated data with some
simulated error, so that they mimic observed data. Phases are calculated
from the correct structure.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">load_data(sname = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sname</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string. Name of the structure whose data
are to be loaded in the workspace. It can be one of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>beryllium_fluoride
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carbon_dioxide
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cyanate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nitronium
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thiocyanate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>xenon_difluoride
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pinkerton2015
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Default is NULL, in which case the function returns a list of all
structures available.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named fdata-type list with the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>a    Real numeric. Unit cell length in angstroms. Always 
included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SG.   Spacegroup 2-letters character string. There are only two 
symmetries possible when working within 1D 
crystallography, P1 (no symmetry) and P-1 (inversion 
through the origin). SG can be either "P1" or "P-1". 
Always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hidx. Real numeric array. 1D unique (positive in the 1D context) 
Miller indices. Always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fobs.      Real numeric array. Amplitudes of observed structure 
factors. Not always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sigFobs.   Real numeric array. Errors associated with Fobs. Not 
always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phicalc.   Real numeric array. Phases (in degrees) of structure 
factors calculated from the correct 1D structure. 
They are normally used to check correctness of 
Phiobs. Not always included.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Load thiocyanate data
fdata &lt;- load_data("thiocyanate")
print(fdata)

# Default returns all names of structures included
load_data()
