<h2>Convert a meaning matrix to a binary 'meaning-feature-present' matrix.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transforms a meaning matrix to 'wide' format where, instead of having
a column for every meaning dimension store all possible meaning values,
every possible value for any dimension is treated as its own categorical
'meaning feature' whose presence or absence is represented by a logical
<code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> value in its own meaning feature column.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">binaryfeaturematrix(meanings, rownames = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>meanings</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix or data frame with meaning dimensions along columns
and different meaning combinations along rows (such as created by
<code>enumerate.meaningcombinations</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rownames</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional character vector of the same length as the number
of rows of <code>meanings</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a matrix or data frame with meaning dimensions along columns and
different combinations of meaning feature values along rows, creates a
a matrix with the same number of rows but with one column for every
possible value for every meaning dimension.
</p>
<p>All meaning dimensions and values are treated <em>categorically</em>, i.e. as
factors with no gradual notion of meaning feature similarity, neither
within nor across the original meaning dimensions. Information about which
feature values correspond to which meaning dimensions is essentially
discarded in this representation, but could in principle be recovered
through the patterns of (non)-co-occurrence of different meaning features.
</p>
<p>In order for the resulting meaning columns to be interpretable, the column
names of the result are of the structure <code>columnname=value</code>, based on
the column names of the input meaning matrix (see Examples).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> values with as many rows as
<code>meanings</code> and one column for every column-value combination in
<code>meanings</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">enumerate.meaningcombinations(c(2, 2))
binaryfeaturematrix(enumerate.meaningcombinations(c(2, 2)))
</code></pre>
