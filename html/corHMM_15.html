<h2>Example datasets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example files for running various functions in <code>corHMM</code>. The “primates” dataset comes from the example files provided by BayesTraits, though here we only include a single tree with branch lengths scaled to time. The “primates.paint” dataset is the same, but with the tree painted according to hypothetical regimes. Finally, the “rayDISC.example” dataset provides an example on how polymorphic data can be coded for <code>rayDISC</code>.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a list object that contains a tree of class “phylo” and a dataframe that contains the trait data</p>
