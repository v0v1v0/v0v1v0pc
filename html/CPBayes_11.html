<h2>An example data of sample-overlap matrices.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An example data of sample-overlap matrices for five different diseases in the Kaiser 
GERA cohort (a real data).
SampleOverlapMatrix is a list that contains an example of the sample overlap matrices
for five different diseases in the Kaiser GERA cohort. SampleOverlapMatrix$n11
provides the number of cases shared between all possible pairs of diseases.
SampleOverlapMatrix$n00 provides the number of controls shared between all possible
pairs of diseases. SampleOverlapMatrix$n10 provides the number of subjects who
are case for one disease and control for another disease.
