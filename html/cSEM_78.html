<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Performs an importance-performance matrix analysis (IPMA).
</p>
<p>To calculate the performance and importance, the weights of the indicators
are unstandardized using the standard deviation of the original
indicators but normed to have a length of 1.
Normed construct scores are calculated based on the original indicators and the
unstandardized weights.
</p>
<p>The importance is calculated as the mean of
the original indicators or the unstandardized construct scores, respectively.
The performance is calculated as the unstandardized total effect if
<code>.level == "construct"</code> and as the normed weight times the unstandardized
total effect if <code>.level == "indicator"</code>. The literature recommends to use an
estimation as input for '<code>doIPMA()</code> that is based on normed
indicators, e.g., by scaling all indicators to 0 to 100,
see e.g., Henseler (2021); Ringle and Sarstedt (2016).
</p>
<p>Note, indicators are not normed internally, as theoretical maximum/minimum can
differ from the empirical maximum/minimum which would lead to an incorrect normalization.
