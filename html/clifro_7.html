<h2>The Clifro Station Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a <code>cfStation</code> object containing station information for one or
more CliFlo stations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cf_station(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>comma separated agent numbers</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A <code>cfStation</code> object is created by the constructor function
<code>cf_station</code>. The unique agent numbers of the stations are all that is
required to create a <code>cfStation</code> object using the <code>cf_station</code>
function. The rest of the station information including the name, network and
agent ID, start and end dates, coordinates, as well as other data is scraped
from CliFlo.
</p>
<p>This function is used for when the agent numbers are already known. For help
creating <code>cfStation</code> objects when the agent numbers are unknown see the
<code>cf_find_station</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>cfStation</code> object
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>cf_find_station</code> for creating <code>cfStation</code> objects
when the agent numbers are not known and <code>vignette("cfStation")</code>
for working with clifro stations including spatial plotting in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. For saving
<code>cfStation</code> objects as KML files refer to the vignette or
<code>cf_save_kml</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Create a cfStation object for the Leigh 1 and 2 Ews stations
leigh.st = cf_station(1339, 1340)
leigh.st

# Note, this can also be achieved using the '+' operator
leigh.st = cf_station(1339) + cf_station(1340)
leigh.st

# Add another column showing how long the stations have been open for
leigh.df = as(leigh.st, "data.frame")
leigh.df$ndays = with(leigh.df, round(end - start))
leigh.df

# Save the stations to the current working directory as a KML to visualise
# the station locations
cf_save_kml(leigh.st)
