<h2>Two-week Repo Rate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function returning data frame of two-week repo rate, as set by ÄŒNB.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">repo2w(date = Sys.Date() - 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>date</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date of fixing as date, default is yesterday.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function expects date input, and returns data frame of two columns - date, and relevant repo rate. It does not require maturity argument, as maturity is by definition 2W.
</p>
<p>Repo rates are reported as fractions, i.e. not as percentages (i.e. 1% is reported as .01, not 1).
</p>
<p>A single result will be reported for all dates higher than December 8th, 1995.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data frame - first column is date, second is relevant two-week repo rate (the primary CZK policy rate)
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
  repo2w(as.Date("2002-08-12"))


</code></pre>
