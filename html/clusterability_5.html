<h2>Data generated from a mixture of two multivariate Normal distributions, 2 dimensions.
A dataset containing 150 observations generated from a mixture of two multivariate
Normal distributions. 75 observations come from a distribution with mean vector
(-3, -2) with each variable having unit variance and uncorrelated with each other.
75 observations come from a distribution with mean vector (1, 1) with each variable
having unit variance and uncorrelated with each other. The dataset is clusterable.</h2>
