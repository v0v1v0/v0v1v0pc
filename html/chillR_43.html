<h2>Download weather data from online database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function retrieves either a list of nearby weather stations for a
specified point location, or it downloads weather data for a specific
weather station.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_weather(
  location,
  time_interval = NA,
  database = "UCIPM",
  station_list = NULL,
  stations_to_choose_from = 25,
  end_at_present = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>location</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a vector of geographic coordinates, or the
'chillRcode' of a weather station in the specified database. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector with two elements, specifying the start
and end date of the period of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>database</code></td>
<td>
<p>the database to be accessed. Must be "GSOD", "CIMIS"
or "UCIPM". Since among these, "UCIPM" is the most
comprehensive one for California, the initial area of interest, this is the
default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>station_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>if the list of weather stations has already been
downloaded, the list can be passed to the function through this argument.
This can save a bit of time, since it can take a bit of time to download the
list, which can have several MB.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stations_to_choose_from</code></td>
<td>
<p>if the location is specified by geographic
coordinates, this argument determines the number of nearby stations in the
list that is returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end_at_present</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating whether the interval of
interest should end on the present day, rather than extending until the end
of the year specified under time_interval[2] (if time_interval[2] is the
current year).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>weather databases, from which chillR can download data: NOAA NCDC Global
Summary of the Day - "GSOD"
(https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
</p>
<p>California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) - "CIMIS"
(http://www.cimis.water.ca.gov/)
</p>
<p>University of California Integrated Pest Management (UCIPM) - "UCIPM"
(http://ipm.ucdavis.edu/WEATHER/)
</p>
<p>several formats are possible for specifying the location vector, which can
consist of either two or three coordinates (it can include elevation).
Possible formats include c(1,2,3), c(1,2), c(x=1,y=2,z=3),
c(lat=2,long=1,elev=3). If elements of the vector are not names, they are
interpreted as c(Longitude, Latitude, Elevation).
</p>
<p>The 'chillRCode' is generated by this function, when it is run with
geographic coordinates as location inputs. In the list of nearby stations
that is returned then, the chillRCode is provided and can then be used as
input for running the function in 'downloading' mode. For downloading the
data, use the same call as before but replace the location argument with the
chillRCode.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output depends on how the location is provided. If it is a
coordinate vector, the function returns a list of station_to_choose_from
weather stations that are close to the specified location. This list also
contains information about how far away these stations are (in km), how much
the elevation difference is (if elevation is specified; in m) and how much
overlap there is between the data contained in the database and the time
period specified by time_interval.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Many databases have data quality flags, which may sometimes indicate
that data aren't reliable. These are not considered by this function!
</p>
<p>see the documentation of the handler functions (e.g. handle_ucipm) for details.
