<h2> 
Fast Growth Rates for Time Series and Panel Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>fgrowth</code> is a S3 generic to compute (sequences of) suitably lagged / leaded, iterated and compounded growth rates, obtained with via the exact method of computation or through log differencing. By default growth rates are provided in percentage terms, but any scale factor can be applied. The growth operator <code>G</code> is a parsimonious wrapper around <code>fgrowth</code>, and also provides more flexibility when applied to data frames.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>fgrowth/G</code> by default computes exact growth rates using <code>repeat(diff) ((x[i]/x[i-n])^power - 1)*scale</code>, so for <code>diff &gt; 1</code> it computes growth rate of growth rates. If <code>logdiff = TRUE</code>, approximate growth rates are computed using <code>log(x[i]/x[i-n])*scale</code> for <code>diff = 1</code> and <code>repeat(diff-1) x[i] - x[i-n]</code> thereafter (usually <code>diff = 1</code> for log-differencing). For further details see the help pages of <code>fdiff</code> and <code>flag</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>x</code> where the growth rate was taken <code>diff</code> times using lags <code>n</code> of itself, scaled by <code>scale</code>. Computations can be grouped by <code>g/by</code> and/or ordered by <code>t</code>. See Details and Examples.
