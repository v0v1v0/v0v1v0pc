<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Polymorphisms - the presence of two or more discrete character states in an operational taxonomic unit - represent perhaps the most complex problem for phylogenetic inference and ancestral state estimation. This is at least in part due to the varied nature their meaning can have (Swofford and Maddison 1992). For example, they may represent true variance within a species or composite variance in some higher taxon represented by a single OTU (something to be avoided if at all possible). Consequently, they cannot - and probably should not - be treated the same by all software in all situations.
</p>
<p>One solution to the problem of polymorphisms is to pretend they do not exist. This is the approach used by common software such as TNT (Goloboff et al. 2008; Goloboff and Catalano 2016), which treat polymorphisms as uncertainties instead. I.e., they assume only one state is the "true" value and use parsimony to (implicitly) estimate what this state is. This approach can be adopted in Claddis too by simply selecting options that treat polymorphisms as uncertainties instead. However, misrepresenting true polymorphisms as uncertainties can leads to incorrect estimates of the amount of evolution (tree length under parsimony; Nixon and Davis 1991) and can disallow, potentially inappropriately, polymorphic values as ancestral state estimates (reconstructions). Claddis therefore offers options to treat polymorphisms as "real".
</p>
<p>There is no single agreed method on dealing with "real" polymorphisms, although many have been proposed (Wiens 1999). Due to the constraints of how Claddis works the only options implemented here - aside from simple approaches like treating them as missing data - are those that work in the costmatrix setting. These are a mixture of novel approaches, extensions of other approaches, or taken directly from Maddison and Maddison (1987).
</p>
<p>Generally speaking the costmatrix setting makes explicit the cost of individual transitions (e.g., from the single state 0 to the polymorphic state 1 <em>and</em> 2) and hence the only decision to make is how these costs should be assigned. Here three approaches are offered: 1) the generalised additive approach, 2) the geometric approach (for unordered characters), and 3) the Maddison approach (for ordered characters). These are described in more detail below.
</p>
<p><b>The additive approach</b>
</p>
<p>One way of conceiving of polymorphic tip states is to conceptually "split" a terminal branch into multiple terminals, each with a single state from the polymorphism at its' tip. For example, a branch leading to the state "0&amp;1" would become two branches, one leading to state 0 and one to state 1. Character costs can then be calculated for each branch separately and then, in order to "merge" these into a single branch, the sum of these costs can be taken. This approach was first suggested in Hoyal Cuthill and Lloyd (in prep) and is here termed the "additive" approach (<code>polymorphism_costs = "additive"</code>). A major advantage to this approach is that it's rules translate across the broadest range of character types. However, there is no logical interpretation of polymorphic ancestral states. (I.e., splitting an ancestral node into two or more nodes is not possible in the same way.) Consequently, transitions "from" polymorphic states are assigned a cost of infinity, precluding them from consideration as ancestral values.
</p>
<p>An example of the additive approach, applied to an unordered character with three states (0, 1, and 2) would thus appear as the following costmatrix:
</p>
<pre>        ---------------------------------------------
        |  0  |  1  |  2  | 0&amp;1 | 0&amp;2 | 1&amp;2 | 0&amp;1&amp;2 |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   0   |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  2  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   1   |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   2   |  1  |  1  |  0  |  2  |  1  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;1  | Inf | Inf | Inf |  0  | Inf | Inf |  Inf  |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;2  | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf |  0  | Inf |  Inf  |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  1&amp;2  | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf |  0  |  Inf  |
-----------------------------------------------------
| 0&amp;1&amp;2 | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf | Inf |   0   |
-----------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p><b>The geometric approach</b>
</p>
<p>An alternative approach based on an idea first suggested by Maddison and Maddison (1987) does allow polymorphisms to be treated as valid ancestral states. Here the conceptual idea is that transitions involve turning "on" or "off" particular states. Thus to go from state 1 to state 0&amp;2 would involve turning "on" states 0 and 2 turning "off" state 1, giving a total cost of three. This approach is only suitable where costs between single states are equal and symmetric - i.e., the character is unordered.
</p>
<p>An example of this approach, applied to an unordered character with three states (0, 1, and 2) would thus appear as the following costmatrix:
</p>
<pre>        ---------------------------------------------
        |  0  |  1  |  2  | 0&amp;1 | 0&amp;2 | 1&amp;2 | 0&amp;1&amp;2 |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   0   |  0  |  2  |  2  |  1  |  1  |  3  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   1   |  2  |  0  |  2  |  1  |  3  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   2   |  2  |  2  |  0  |  3  |  1  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;1  |  1  |  1  |  3  |  0  |  2  |  2  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;2  |  1  |  3  |  1  |  2  |  0  |  2  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  1&amp;2  |  3  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  0  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
| 0&amp;1&amp;2 |  2  |  2  |  2  |  1  |  1  |  1  |   0   |
-----------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>Note: to maintain a base cost of one the original single-state-to-single-state transitions are doubled from one to two. In order to avoid this affecting tree lengths the character weight is halved.
</p>
<p>This Maddison and Maddison (1987) approach is extended here by drawing on an analogy, namely that this cost assignment is identical to considering a hypercube whose vertices lie at one of two (presence or absence) positions on orthogonal axes representing individual states. Thus the polymorphism 0&amp;2 is at the coordinates (0 = present, 1 = absent, 2 = present). Here costs can be assigned by taking the minimum Manhattan distance between each pair of vertices. NB: here the origin (absence of all states) is unoccupied, but this does not affect the assignment of costs.
</p>
<p>This analogy is why the approach is here termed the "geometric" approach (<code>polymorphism_costs = "geometric"</code>). Importantly, although the example above only represents the regular cube (three states = three dimensions) the approach translates to any number of states (i.e., any number of dimensions) without loss of generality, and hence this particular option is properly termed a hypercube (i.e., <code>polymorphism_geometry = "hypercube"</code> and <code>polymorphism_distance = "manhattan"</code>).
</p>
<p>In of itself this does not change what was proposed by Maddison and Maddison. However, the geometric setting allows us to consider both different shapes (topologies) and different distance measures, as long as the same generality to higher dimensions holds. Two additional shapes are offered here. These are the hypersphere (the N-dimensional circle) and the simplex (the N-dimensional equilateral triangle). In addition, two distances are also offered. These are Euclidean (the straight line distance between two points) and Great circle (the shortest distance across the "surface" of a hypersphere) distances.
</p>
<p>These distances are intended to match respective straights (hypercube and Manhattan, hypersphere and Great Circle, simplex and Euclidean), but any combination is permitted. Furthermore, and as above, all costs are rescaled such that the base transition cost is always one with the character weight modified accordingly.
</p>
<p><b>The Maddison approach</b>
</p>
<p>Although the above approach is based on Maddison and Maddison (1987) the Maddison name (<code>polymorphism_costs = "maddison"</code>) is here reserved for an approach proposed by the same authors (Maddison and Maddison 2000) for use with ordered characters. The concept of this approach shares the idea of "switching" states on and off but here adds the idea of adjacency of switches. In other words, intermediate states (the essential element of an ordered character) are additional switches that must be turned "on" and "off" again in order to "reach" other states. Thus to go from state 0 to state 0 and 2 for the linear ordered character 0-1-2 we would have to turn "on" state to reach state "2", which is also turned on. Then we would turn off state "1", meaning  total of three switches were flipped which would be the cost. Note: that here we are not turning "off" state 0 as it is present at both ends of the transition.
</p>
<p>Extending our three state linear ordered example to all possible transitions we get the costmatrix:
</p>
<pre>        ---------------------------------------------
        |  0  |  1  |  2  | 0&amp;1 | 0&amp;2 | 1&amp;2 | 0&amp;1&amp;2 |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   0   |  0  |  2  |  4  |  1  |  3  |  3  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   1   |  2  |  0  |  2  |  1  |  3  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|   2   |  4  |  2  |  0  |  3  |  3  |  1  |   2   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;1  |  1  |  1  |  3  |  0  |  2  |  2  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  0&amp;2  |  3  |  3  |  3  |  2  |  0  |  2  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
|  1&amp;2  |  3  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  0  |   1   |
-----------------------------------------------------
| 0&amp;1&amp;2 |  2  |  2  |  2  |  1  |  1  |  1  |   0   |
-----------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>NB: Again the single-state-to-single-state cost is modified (doubled) meaning the character weight is halved.
</p>
<p><b>The stratigraphic approach</b>
</p>
<p>The stratigraphic case seems like it ought to follow the same rule as irreversible characters (see below), but here "polymorphisms" have a different logical meaning. Specifically they encode the presence of a taxon in multiple time units. Thus, transitions <em>to</em> a stratigraphic polymorphism are based on the oldest state. By contrast, polymorphisms can never be ancestral states as there would be no basis to choose between (e.g.) state 0 and state 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>The option <code>polymorphism_costs = "stratigraphic"</code> is only available where <code>costmatrix$type</code> is <code>"stratigraphic"</code> and, where <code>costmatrix$type</code> is <code>"stratigraphic"</code>, <code>polymorphism_costs = "stratigraphic"</code> is the only option.
</p>
<p><b>Additional considerations</b>
</p>
<p>Aside from these three options there are some further considerations the user should make with respect to some more complex character types. These are discussed below under appropriate headers.
</p>
<p><em>Dollo and irreversible polymorphisms</em>
</p>
<p>At first blush Dollo and irreversible (Camin-Sokal) characters appear to confound costmatrix construction. More specifically, for a Dollo character, the state 0 and 1 would suggest state 1 was acquired previously, but lost in some member(s) of the OTU. For an irreversible character the opposite would be true, and we would assume that state 1 was acquired independently by some member(s) of the OTU and state 0 was acquired previously. It is not possible to code either of these outcomes under the geometric or Maddison approaches. However, the additive approach perfectly captures this nuance. Thus tree length calculation and ancestral state estimation for Dollo and Camin-Sokal characters is possible under the additive approach and only the possibility of polymorphic ancestral states is excluded.
</p>
<p><em>Transitions between uncertainties and polymorphisms</em>
</p>
<p>Because Claddis also permits users to include uncertainties in costmatrices transitions between these and polymorphisms must also be considered. Here this is automated by using the "minimum rule". In practice this means a transition from, for example, state 0 and 1 to state 1 or 2 will take the lowest cost of the two options (from state 0 and 1 to state 1 <em>or</em> from state 0 and 1 to state 2). In the case of the additive approach these costs will always be infinite. In all cases transitions from uncertainties are assigned infinite cost as these are not considered valid ancestral states.
</p>
<p><em>Polymorphism limits and gap-weighted characters</em>
</p>
<p>Even where polymorphisms may be appropriate (i.e., for some ordered and unordered characters) they still represent a major increase to costmatrix size that can cause memory limits to be hit. Specifically, and as shown in the hypercube example above, there will be as many possible states as N^2 - 1, where N is the number of single (i.e., non-polymorphic) states and the minus one indicates the exclusion of the unrepresentable origin value. Thus the size of costmatrix required grows very quickly:
</p>
<pre>------------------------------
| N states | Costmatrix size |
------------------------------
|     2    |      3 x 3      |
|     3    |      7 x 7      |
|     4    |     15 x 15     |
|     5    |     31 x 31     |
|     6    |     63 x 63     |
|     7    |    127 x 127    |
|     8    |    255 x 255    |
|     9    |    511 x 511    |
|    10    |   1023 x 1023   |
|    11    |   2047 x 2047   |
|    12    |   4095 x 4095   |
|    13    |   8191 x 8191   |
|    14    |  16383 x 16383  |
------------------------------</pre>
<p>Because of this, the function will become extremely slow for these higher values and here is hard-capped at no more than fourteen states. Consequently any gap-weighted characters are also most likely inappropriate for polymorphism use (as well as being too memory intensive).
