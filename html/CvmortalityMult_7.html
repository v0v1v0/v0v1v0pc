<h2>Function to plot the parameters of the multi-population mortality models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to plot different results of the forecasting process of multi-population mortality models, the additive (Debon et al., 2011) and the multiplicative (Russolillo et al., 2011), obtained using the <code>forecast.fitLCmulti</code> function which are xs of the <code>forecastLCmulti</code> class.
In fact, the function will show the trend parameter kt fitted for the in-sample periods and its forecast results. Similarly, the behavior of the logit mortality rate for the mean in-sample age and the out-of-sample forecast will be shown for all the populations considered.
It should be mentioned that this function is developed for fitting several populations.
However, in case you only consider one population, the function will show the single population version of the Lee-Carter model, the classical one.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>plot the trend parameter kt fitted for the in-sample periods and its forecast results for the multi-population mortality models. Similarly, the behavior of the logit mortality rate for the mean in-sample age and the out-of-sample forecast will be shown for all the populations considered.
