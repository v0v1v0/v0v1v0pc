<h2>Functions to manipulate variables' or project's folder structure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Variables in Crunch datasets are organized into folders, like in a file
system. Datasets are similarly organized into hierarchical Projects.
These functions allow you to create new folders and move objects into
folders. Their names, <code>mv</code> and <code>mkdir</code>, suggest their Unix file utility
inspiration.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mv(x, what, path)

mkdir(x, path)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>CrunchDataset</code> or <code>Folder</code> (<code>VariableFolder</code> or <code>ProjectFolder</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>what</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Variable, selection of variables from <code>dataset</code>, or any
other object that can be moved to a folder (e.g. a dataset when organizing
projects).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character "path" to the folder: either a
vector of nested folder names or a single string with nested folders
separated by a delimiter ("/" default, configurable via
<code>options(crunch.delimiter)</code>). The path is interpreted as
relative to the location of the folder <code>x</code> (when <code>x</code> is a dataset, that
means the root, top-level folder). <code>path</code> may also be a <code>Folder</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions have some differences from the strict behavior of their Unix
ancestors. For one, they work recursively, without additional arguments:
<code>mkdir</code> will make every directory necessary to construct the requested path,
even if all parent directories didn't already exist; and <code>mv</code> doesn't
require that the directory to move to already existâ€”it will effectively
call <code>mkdir</code> along the way.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>x</code>, with the folder at <code>path</code> guaranteed to be created, and for
<code>mv</code>, containing <code>what</code> moved into it.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>cd()</code> to select a folder by path; <code>rmdir()</code> to delete a folder;
<code>folder()</code> to identify and set an object's parent folder;
<code>base::dir.create()</code>
if you literally want to create a directory in your local file system, which
<code>mkdir()</code> does not do
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
ds &lt;- loadDataset("Example survey")
ds &lt;- mv(ds, c("gender", "age", "educ"), "Demographics")
ds &lt;- mkdir(ds, "Key Performance Indicators/Brand X")
# These can also be chained together
require(magrittr)
ds &lt;- ds %&gt;%
    mv(c("aware_x", "nps_x"), "Key Performance Indicators/Brand X") %&gt;%
    mv(c("aware_y", "nps_y"), "Key Performance Indicators/Brand Y")
# Can combine with cd() and move things with relative paths
ds %&gt;%
    cd("Key Performance Indicators/Brand X") %&gt;%
    mv("nps_x", "../Net Promoters")
# Can combine with folder() to move objects to the same place as something else
ds %&gt;% mv("nps_y", folder(ds$nps_x))
# Now let's put ds in a Project
projects() %&gt;%
    mv(ds, "Brand Tracking Studies")

## End(Not run)
