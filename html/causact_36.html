<h2>Install causact's python dependencies like numpyro, arviz, and xarray.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>install_causact_deps()</code> installs python, the numpyro and arviz packages, and their
direct dependencies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">install_causact_deps()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>You may be prompted to download and install miniconda if reticulate
did not find a non-system installation of python. Miniconda is the
only supported installation method for users, as it ensures that the R
python installation is isolated from other python installations. All python
packages will by default be installed into a self-contained conda or venv
environment named "r-causact". Note that "conda" is the only supported method for install.
</p>
<p>If you initially declined the miniconda installation prompt, you can later
manually install miniconda by running <code>reticulate::install_miniconda()</code>.
</p>
<p>If you manually configure a python environment with the required
dependencies, you can tell R to use it by pointing reticulate at it,
commonly by setting an environment variable:
