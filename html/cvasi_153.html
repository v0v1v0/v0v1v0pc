<h2>Simulate an effect scenario</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The supplied <code>EffectScenario</code> is passed on to the ODE solver for numerical
integration. Internally, <code>simulate()</code> is split up into several functions
dedicated to particular models, e.g. one for GUTS and one for Lemna type
models. The package will take care of using the correct function
for each model when <code>simulate()</code> is called.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simulate(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'EffectScenario'
simulate(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'Transferable'
simulate(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'ScenarioSequence'
simulate(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>scenario to simulate</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Simulation results are returned as a time-series for each state
variable. Some models provide additional properties describing the model state,
e.g. the internal concentration of a toxicant within the organism. Refer
to the respective scenario for more information.
</p>
<p>Additional arguments to <code>simulate()</code> will be passed on to <code>deSolve::ode()</code>
which enables control of the numerical integration parameters.
</p>


<h4>Output times and windows</h4>

<p>The minimum and maximum of given time points generally define the simulated
period. Function argument <code>times</code> overrides settings of the scenario, i.e.
time points set in <code>scenario@times</code>. However, the simulation can be limited to
a subset of time points by enabling a moving exposure window, see <code>set_window()</code>.
</p>
<p>Results will be returned for each time point. Precision of the numeric solver
may be affected by chosen output times in certain cases. Hence, small deviations
in results should be expected if different output times are set. This effect
can be mitigated by either defining are sufficiently small time step for the solver
using argument <code>hmax</code> or by decreasing the error tolerances <code>atol</code> and <code>rtol</code>.
These arguments are passed to the solver, see e.g. <code>deSolve::lsoda()</code> for details.
</p>



<h4>Optional output variables</h4>

<p>Some models support adding intermediary model variables to the return value
of <code>simulate()</code>. Analyzing the additional outputs may be helpful to understand
model behavior and support finding potential issues in model parameterization.
</p>
<p>Optional outputs are enabled by setting the parameter <code>nout</code> to a value greater
than zero. If <code>nout</code> is set to <code>n</code>, then the first <code>n</code> optional output columns
will be returned along the normal simulation result.
</p>
<p>Which optional outputs are available depends on the model/scenario at hand.
Please refer to the model documentation for details.
As an example, the GUTS-RED-IT model supports adding the
external toxicant concentration to the output by setting <code>nout=1</code>:
</p>
<p><code>minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(nout=1)</code>
</p>



<h4>Numerical precision and stability</h4>

<p>Each model was assigned a default ODE solver which handles most of the
occurring inputs well. In most cases, this will be an explicit numerical
scheme of the Runge-Kutta family with variable step width. For certain extreme
parameters settings, such as very high uptake/permeability of the contaminant
or exposure series which represent step functions, the numerical approximation
might deteriorate and yield invalid results. In this case try to decrease the
allowed max step width by setting the argument <code>hmax</code> with various values.
Start with <code>hmax=1</code> and decrease the value by orders of 10. It is not
possible or desirable to reduce <code>hmax</code> to extremely small values, as the
ODE solver will require more CPU time and simulation will become inefficient.
</p>
<p>Oftentimes, it will be computational more efficient to adapt the solver's
error tolerances <code>atol</code> and <code>rtol</code> than reducing the step width <code>hmax</code> to achieve
stable numerics. Start by decreasing deSolve's default values by
orders of ten until the simulation yields acceptable results, see e.g.
<code>deSolve::lsoda()</code> for more information on error tolerances.
</p>
<p>As an alternative to adapting solver parameters, it might be worthwhile to
try other numerical schemes which can handle stiff ODEs, such as Radau, LSODA,
or LSODES. To change solvers, set the <code>method</code> argument.
To select e.g. the Radau scheme, set <code>method="radau"</code>. For LSODA, set <code>method="lsoda"</code>.
Radau performs better than LSODA in some cases, as the latter method can return
biologically nonsensical results without raising an error. See <code>deSolve::ode()</code>
for details on available ODE solvers.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with the time-series of simulation results
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">minnow_sd %&gt;% simulate() # tidy syntax
simulate(minnow_sd) # base R syntax

# Set new output times
minnow_sd %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,4))

# Modify simulated time frame
minnow_sd %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,10))

# Use an alternative exposure profile than defined in the scenario
minnow_sd %&gt;% set_exposure(data.frame(t=0,c=10), reset_times=FALSE) %&gt;% simulate()

##
## Precision of results

# A large number of output times forces smaller solver time steps
minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=seq(0,1,0.001)) %&gt;% tail()

# Defining only two output times allows for larger solver time steps
minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,1))

# The difference between results can be reduced by limiting the solver's
# maximum step length
minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,1), hmax=0.001)

# The same numerical precision can be achieved by switching to
# the Radau scheme
minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,1), method="radau")

# A very small step length may reduce the difference even further but may
# also exceed the allowed number of steps per output interval. The following
# simulation will be aborted with a solver error:
try(
  minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,1), hmax=0.0001)
)

# However, the solver's max number of allowed steps can be increased:
minnow_it %&gt;% simulate(times=c(0,1), hmax=0.0001, maxsteps=10^5)
