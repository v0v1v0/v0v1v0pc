<h2>Find time bin midpoints</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the midpoint values for each bin from a timeBins object
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">find_time_bin_midpoints(time_bins)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_bins</code></td>
<td>
<p>A timeBins object.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Frequently the midpoints of a series of time bins (defined by a beginning and ending) will be required, for example, when plotting binned data as a time series. Although the calculation involved is trivial (i.e., start date + end date / 2) this is a sufficiently common operation it is made into a formal function here.
</p>
<p>Note that this function is designed to work specifically with objects of class "timeBins" - a format specific to Claddis that looks something like this:
</p>
<pre>                  fad  lad
    Cenomanian    99.6 93.5
    Turonian      93.5 89.3
    Coniacian     89.3 85.8
    Santonian     85.8 83.5
    Campanian     83.5 70.6
    Maastrichtian 70.6 65.5</pre>
<p>I.e., a matrix with two columns (fad = first appearance date and lad = last appearance date) with rows corresponding to named time bins and indiviual values ages in millions of years ago (Ma). The object should also have class <code>timeBins</code> (see example below for hot to generate such an object). Note also that the convention here is to have time bins be ordered from oldest to youngest.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of time bin midpoint values.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Create a time bins object:
time_bins &lt;- matrix(
  data = c(99.6, 93.5, 93.5, 89.3, 89.3, 85.8, 85.8, 83.5, 83.5, 70.6, 70.6, 65.5),

  dimnames = list(
    c("Cenomanian", "Turonian", "Coniacian", "Santonian", "Campanian", "Maastrichtian"),
    c("fad", "lad")

)

# Set class as timeBins:
class(time_bins) &lt;- "timeBins"

# Return midpoints for each time bin in sequence:
