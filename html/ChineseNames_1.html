<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A database of Chinese surnames and Chinese given names (1930-2008).

1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used in given names,
covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese population
(96.8% of the Han Chinese household-registered population
born from 1930 to 2008 and still alive in 2008).
This package also contains a function for computing multiple features of
Chinese surnames and Chinese given names for scientific research (e.g.,
name uniqueness, name gender, name valence, and name warmth/competence).
