<h2>Measure Length of Use Pattern before Dropout</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the number of visits in the pattern until the last subject
contact
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">measure_retention(use_pattern, missing_is = "o")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use_pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string showing the daily, by visit, or weekly
substance use pattern for a single subject</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_is</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which single character is used to mark missing UDS in a
use pattern string? Defaults to <code>"o"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>At current, we allow for many symbols in the use pattern "word",
such as "_" for missing by study design, "o" missing for protocol
non-compliance (the most common form of missing), "+" for positive, "-" for
negative, and "*" for mixed positive and negative results (this usually
comes up when the visit represents multiple days and there are both
positive and negative results in those days; for example, a subject is
tested weekly; they provided a positive test on Tuesday but came back to
provide a negative test the following day).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An integer measuring the number of visits before the subject was lost
to follow-up. If the subject's entire use pattern is missing, then this
will be 0.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  pattern_char &lt;- "__++++*o-------+--+-o-o-o+o+oooooo"
  measure_retention(pattern_char)
  
  pattern2_char &lt;- "ooooooooooo"
  measure_retention(pattern2_char)
