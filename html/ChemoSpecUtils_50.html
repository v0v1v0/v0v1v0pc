<h2>Color in ChemoSpec and ChemoSpec2D</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In <code>ChemoSpec</code> and <code>ChemoSpec2D</code>, the user may use any color name/format
known to R.  The current color scheme of a <code>Spectra</code> or
<code>Spectra2D</code> object
may be determined using <code>sumGroups</code> or <code>sumSpectra</code>.
The colors can also be queried and changed using <code>conColScheme</code>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Colors are stored as character vectors and symbols as numeric vectors.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An important fact to keep in mind is that most people with normal vision cannot distinguish
more than about 8-12 colors, and doing so depends upon the viewing circumstances:
if on paper, printer, ink and paper type all matter, and if on a screen, the background color
makes a big difference.  Further, color-blind individuals have additional challenges.
A great discussion of color issues can be found in the <code>colorspace</code> package.  The
<code>Polychrome</code> package has further discussion and utilities for choosing qualitative
colorschemes, including those for color-blind individuals.
</p>
<p><code>ChemoSpec</code>, but not <code>ChemoSpec2D</code>, can also create plots using
the built-in symbols and lower case letters.  This is useful for color-blind individuals,
plots in <code>rgl</code> which can't plot regular symbols, and plots for where there are
more groups than could be reasonably coded in color.  A good discussion of which symbols
are most readily distinguished can be found in Robinson: "Good Plot Symbols by Default"
<em>Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics</em> DOI: 10.1080/10618600.2019.1637746
</p>
<p><code>ChemoSpecUtils</code> supplies four color/symbol schemes for your consideration.
If the particular order of colors in any of these does not suit your needs, you can always
choose the ones you want, and/or rearrange the order, or simply provide your own.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The colors and symbols produced by <code>gr.cols = "auto"</code> in the import functions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Col8</code> provides eight unique colors.  These are more saturated
than the automatic colors.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Col12</code> provides a mostly paired set of 12 unique colors suitable for groups
that come in pairs.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Col7</code> provides seven color-blind friendly colors.  These can be visualized
at https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette by using the hex codes obtained
by typing <code>data(Col7); Col7</code> in the <code>R</code> console.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
