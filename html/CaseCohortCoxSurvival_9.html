Example of case-cohort with unstratified sampling of the subcohort and missing covariate information in phase-two data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>List with <code>cohort</code>.
</p>
<p><code>cohort</code> is a simulated cohort with 20 000 subjects. It contains:
</p>
<p><code>id</code> is the subject identifier.
</p>
<p><code>X1</code> is a continuous baseline covariate. Its measurements are only available for subjects in the case-cohort, i.e., with <code>phase3 = 1</code>.
</p>
<p><code>X2</code> is a categorical baseline covariate, with categories 0, 1, and 2. It is measured on all cohort subjects.
</p>
<p><code>X3</code> is a continuous baseline covariate. Its measurements are only available for subjects in the case-cohort.
</p>
<p><code>status</code> indicates case status.
</p>
<p><code>event.time</code> gives the event or censoring time. <code>status</code> indicates whether the subject experienced the event of interest or was censored.
</p>
<p>The sampling of the subcohort was not stratified. 1053 subjects were sampled (independently of case status) from the cohort. <code>subcohort</code> indicates all these subjects included in the subcohort.
</p>
<p>The phase-two sample consisted of the subcohort and any other cases not in the subcohort. <code>phase2</code> indicates all these subjects included in the phase-two sample.
</p>
<p><code>W3</code> is a baseline binary variable, based on case status. It is measured on all cohort subjects.
</p>
<p>The third phase of sampling was stratified based on the 2 strata defined by <code>W3</code>. Subjects were sampled from the 2 strata with sampling probabilities 0.9 and 0.8. <code>phase3</code> indicates all these subjects included in the case-cohort (phase-three sample).
</p>
<p><code>n</code> gives the number of subjects in the cohort.
</p>
<p><code>m</code> gives the number of subjects sampled from the cohort (i.e., 1053).
</p>
<p><code>m</code> and <code>n</code> would be used to compute the design weights of non-cases. Because all the cases were included in the case-cohort, they would be assigned a design weight of 1.
</p>
<p><code>n.cases</code> gives the number of cases in the entire cohort.
</p>
<p><code>W3</code> is a baseline binary variable, based on case status. It is measured on all cohort subjects.
</p>
<p><code>strata.proba.missing</code> gives the the sampling probablity for the 2 phase-three strata based on <code>W3</code> and that were used for the third phase of sampling.
</p>
<p><code>weight.true</code> gives the true design weight (i.e., product of the phase-two and true phase-three design weight).
</p>
<p><code>weight.p2.true</code> gives true phase-two design weight. They are stratum-specific based on <code>W</code>.
</p>
<p><code>weight.p3.true</code> gives the true phase-three design weight. They are stratum-specific based on <code>W3</code>. <code>weight.p3.true</code> can be used with argument <code>weights.phase3</code> of function <code>caseCohortCoxSurvival</code>, along with argument <code>weights.phase3.type = "design"</code>.
</p>
<p><code>weight.p3.est</code> gives the estimated phase-three design weight. They were obtained from <code>W3</code>, <code>phase2</code> and <code>phase3</code>. <code>weight.p3.est</code> can be used with argument <code>weights.phase3</code> of function <code>caseCohortCoxSurvival</code>, along with argument <code>weights.phase3.type = "estimated"</code>. If in function <code>caseCohortCoxSurvival</code> <code>weights.phase3 = NULL</code> but <code>weights.phase3.type = "estimated"</code>, the phase-three design weights will be estimated from <code>W3</code>, <code>phase2</code> and <code>phase3</code> and should be identical.
</p>
<p><code>weight.est</code> gives the estimated design weight (i.e., product of the phase-two and estimated phase-three design weight).
