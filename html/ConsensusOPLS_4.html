<h2>Three-block omics data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A demonstration case study available from a public repository
of the National Cancer Institute, namely the NCI-60 data set, was used to 
illustrate the method's potential for omics data fusion. A subset of NCI-60
data (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) involving experimental 
data from 14 cancer cell lines from two tissue origins, i.e. colon and 
ovary, was used. The object proposed in this package contains, in a list, 
all the information needed to make a model: the three data blocks, a list 
of observation names (samples) and the binary response matrix Y.
