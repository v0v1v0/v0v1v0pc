<h2>Select markers for the pairwise scan.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function selects markers for the pairwise scan.
Beause Cape is computationally intensive, pairscans 
should not be run on large numbers of markers. 
As a rule of thumb, 1500 markers in a population of 
500 individuals takes about 24 hours to run without the
kinship correction. The kinship correction increases the
time of the analysis, and users may wish to reduce the number
of markers scanned even further to accommodate the extra
computational burden of the kinship correction.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">select_markers_for_pairscan(
  data_obj,
  singlescan_obj,
  geno_obj,
  specific_markers = NULL,
  num_alleles = 50,
  peak_density = 0.5,
  window_size = NULL,
  tolerance = 5,
  plot_peaks = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  pdf_filename = "Peak.Plots.pdf"
)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>Cape</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>singlescan_obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>a singlescan object from <code>singlescan</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>geno_obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>a genotype object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>specific_markers</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of marker names specifying which
markers should be selected. If NULL, the function uses main effect
size to select markers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num_alleles</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target number of markers to select if using
main effect size</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>peak_density</code></td>
<td>
<p>The fraction of markers to select under each 
peak exceeding the current threshold. Should be set higher for populations
with low LD. And should be set lower for populations with high LD. Defaults 
to 0.5, corresponding to 50% of markers selected under each peak.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of markers to use in a smoothing window when
calculating main effect peaks. If NULL, the window size is selected automatically
based on the number of markers with consecutive rises and falls of main effect
size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tolerance</code></td>
<td>
<p>The allowable deviation from the target marker number in
number of markers. For example, If you ask the function to select 100 markers,
an set the tolerance to 5, the algorithm will stop when it has selected between
95 and 105 markers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot_peaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to plot the singlescan peaks identified by <code>bin_curve</code>.
This can be helpful in determining whether the window_size and peak_density parameters 
are optimal for the population.</p>

<td><code>verbose</code></td>

<p>Whether progress should be printed to the screen</p>

<p>If plot_peaks is TRUE, this argument specifies the filename
to which the peaks are plotted.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can select markers either from a pre-defined list
input as the argument <code>specific_markers</code>, or can select
markers based on their main effect size.
</p>
<p>To select markers based on main effect size, this function 
first identifies effect score peaks using an automated
peak detection algorithm. It finds the peaks rising 
above a starting threshold and samples markers within each
peak based on the user-defined sampling density <code>peak_density</code>.
Setting <code>peak_density</code> to 0.5 will result in 50% of the markers
in a given peak being sampled uniformly at random. Sampling
reduces the redundancy among linked markers tested in the pairscan.
If LD is relatively low in the population, this density can be
increased to 1 to include all markers under a peak. If LD is high,
the density can be decreased to reduce redundancy further. 
</p>
<p>The algorithm compares the number of markers sampled to the target
defined by the user in the argument <code>num_alleles</code>. If fewer
than the target have been selected, the threshold is lowered, and 
the process is repeated until the target number of alleles have
been selected (plus or minus the number set in <code>tolerance</code>).
</p>
<p>If the number of target alleles exceeds the number of markers
genotyped, all alleles will be selected automatically.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the <code>Cape</code> object with a new matrix called
<code>geno_for_pairscan</code> containing the genotypes of the selected markers
for each individual.
