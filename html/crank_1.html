<h2>Ordered option selections to ranks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert ordered option selections to ranks, assigning the mean of unused
ranks to unselected options.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> cats2ranks(x,cats=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data frame of numeric or characters labels for options.
Rows are interpreted as cases or respondents and columns are interpreted as
the order of option selections, beginning with the highest ranking
(usually something like "Most important") and descending.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cats</code></td>
<td>
<p>The range of numbers that represent options. The default is the
vector of unique entries in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠cats2ranks⁠</span>’ converts ordered option selections to mean ranks. It is
useful in the situation where a respondent is asked to select one of a number
of options as the most important, another as the second most important, and
so on. It counts the number of times each option code appears in each column
and calculates the mean ranking of options. It is expected that there will be
fewer selections available than there are options, thus creating the opportunity
for biased rankings. This can occur when one or more options are not commonly
chosen, but are given extreme (usually high) ranks when they are. The function
calculates the mean of unallocated ranks and assigns this to all options not
chosen by each respondent, correcting for this bias. The correction assumes
that the respondent does not differentiate between unranked options, but these
are all ranked lower than the options selected.
</p>
<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠cats2ranks⁠</span>’ is especially useful when respondents do not select the same
number of options. The mean of unallocated ranks is calculated for each
respondent so that all options are entered into the calculation of mean ranks.
</p>
<p>Note that ‘<span class="samp">⁠cats2ranks⁠</span>’ interprets each value in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ as a nominal
level variable and its column index as the rank, while ‘<span class="samp">⁠meanranks⁠</span>’
interprets values as ordinal level (ranks). Thus if a matrix or data frame
of ranks is passed to ‘<span class="samp">⁠cats2ranks⁠</span>’, it will not give the correct mean
ranks or relative positions.
