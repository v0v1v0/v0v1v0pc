<h2>Bloom prediction from chilling and forcing requirements, assumed to be
fulfilled strictly in sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a pretty rudimentary function to predict phenological dates from
chilling and forcing requirements and hourly chilling and forcing data. Note
that there are enormous uncertainties in these predictions, which are hardly
ever acknowledged. So please use this function with caution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bloom_prediction(
  HourChillTable,
  Chill_req,
  Heat_req,
  Chill_model = "Chill_Portions",
  Heat_model = "GDH",
  Start_JDay = 305
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HourChillTable</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame resulting from the chilling_hourtable
function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Chill_req</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric parameter indicating the chilling requirement of
the particular growth stage (in the unit specified by "Chill_model")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Heat_req</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric parameter indicating the heat requirement of the
particular growth stage (in Growing Degree Hours)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Chill_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string specifying the chill model to use. This
has to correspond to the name of the column in HourChillTable that contains
the chill accumulation (e.g "Chilling_Hours", "Chill_Portions" and "Chill_Units").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Heat_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string specifying the heat model to use. This
has to correspond to the name of the column in HourChillTable that contains
the heat accumulation (e.g "GDH").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Start_JDay</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric parameter indicating the day when chill
accumulation is supposed to start</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is a bit preliminary at the moment. It will hopefully be
refined later.
</p>
<p>Chill metrics are calculated as given in the references below. Chilling
Hours are all hours with temperatures between 0 and 7.2 degrees C. Units of
the Utah Model are calculated as suggested by Richardson et al. (1974)
(different weights for different temperature ranges, and negation of
chilling by warm temperatures). Chill Portions are calculated according to
Fishman et al. (1987a,b). More honestly, they are calculated according to an
Excel sheet produced by Amnon Erez and colleagues, which converts the
complex equations in the Fishman papers into relatively simple Excel
functions. These were translated into R. References to papers that include
the full functions are given below. Growing Degree Hours are calculated
according to Anderson et al. (1986), using the default values they suggest.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data frame containing the predicted dates of chilling requirement
fulfillment and timing of the phenological stage. Columns are Creqfull,
Creq_year, Crey_month, Creq_day and Creq_JDay (the row number, date and
Julian date of chilling requirement fulfillement), Hreqfull, Hreq_year,
Hreq_month, Hreq_day and Hreq_JDay (the row number, date and Julian date of
heat requirement fulfillment - this corresponds to the timing of the
phenological event.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>After doing extensive model comparisons, and reviewing a lot of
relevant literature, I do not recommend using the Chilling Hours or Utah
Models, especially in warm climates! The Dynamic Model (Chill Portions),
though far from perfect, seems much more reliable.
