<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The common language statistic is defined for continuous data as “the probability that a score sampled at random from one distribution will be greater than a score sampled from some other distribution” (McGraw and Wong, 1992).
</p>
<p>Given the default value of <code>distribution</code> (‘<span class="samp">⁠normal⁠</span>’), this function uses <code>pnorm</code> to calculate the probability that a random sample from the unit normal distribution is greater than the Z score (i.e. (the mean of ‘<span class="samp">⁠y⁠</span>’ minus the mean of ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’) / square root of (variance of ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ plus variance of ‘<span class="samp">⁠y⁠</span>’)).
</p>
<p>If <code>distribution</code> is NA, this function calculates the empirical probability that the difference is positive, that is, the fraction of all possible pairings between elements of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> where the difference (‘<span class="samp">⁠y⁠</span>’ value - ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ value) is positive.
It may not be possible to calculate the empirical probability for very large samples because of memory limits.
</p>
<p>The examples use <em>simulated data for normal distributions</em>, given the sample size, mean, and standard deviation of datasets cited by McGraw and Wong, 1992.
Therefore, the empirical probability in the examples approaches the normal curve probability.
However, the empirical probability for <em>nonnormal</em> distributions is distinct from the normal curve probability, as discussed on p. 364-365 of McGraw and Wong, 1992.
