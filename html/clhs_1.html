<h2>Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, as
published by Minasny and McBratney (2006) and the DLHS variant method 
(Minasny and McBratney, 2010).. This method proposes to stratify sampling in 
presence of ancillary data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An extension of this method, which propose to associate a cost to each
individual and take it into account during the optimisation process, is also
proposed (Roudier et al., 2012).
