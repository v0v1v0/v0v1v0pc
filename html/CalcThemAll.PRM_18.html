<h2>Log-Normal Log-Normal (double curve) CDF Equation Formula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Log-Normal Log-Normal (double curve) CDF Equation Formula
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Log_Normal_Log_Normal_Formula(
  concentration,
  shape_location,
  scale,
  shape_location_2,
  scale_2,
  weight
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>concentration</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of concentration values for a selected pesticide,
that has a Log Normal Log Normal species sensitivity distribution,
to run the equation on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shape_location</code></td>
<td>
<p>The mu/shape value for the first Log Normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>The sigma/scale value for the first Log Normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shape_location_2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The mu/shape value for the second Log Normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale_2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The sigma/scale value for the second Log Normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>The weight parameter for combining the two equations for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
