<h2>Detect a Consecutive Sub-Pattern</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a use pattern string, detect if that pattern contains a
consecutive sub-pattern of interest
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">detect_subpattern(use_pattern, subpattern, start = 1, end = -1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use_pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string showing the daily, by visit, or weekly
substance use pattern for a single subject</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subpattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string containing the sub-pattern of interest.
For example, if study dropout is seven consecutive missing UDS, then the
sub-pattern would be "ooooooo".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>These two arguments give the integer range wherein to look for
the use sub-pattern of interest. Usually, start should be the week of
randomization. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end</code></td>
<td>
<p>The end of the detection range. This is often the end of followup
(denoted by -1, the default value, which represents the last item in the
string), or this could be a set number of weeks or visits, such as 12 weeks
or 48 visits.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can be used to detect consecutive periods of drug
abstinence, drug use, or study non-compliance (as measured by failure to
supply urine). For example, to detect if the subject had three consecutive
use weeks, the sub-pattern would be set to <code>"+++"</code>.
</p>
<p>At current, we allow for many symbols in the use pattern "word", such as
"_" for missing by study design, "o" missing for protocol non-compliance
(the most common form of missing), "+" for positive, "-" for negative, and
"*" for mixed positive and negative results (this usually comes up when the
visit represents multiple days and there are both positive and negative
results in those days; for example, a subject is tested weekly; they
provided a positive test on Tuesday but came back to provide a negative
test the following day).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single logical value indicating if the use subpattern is present in
the overall use pattern string
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  # This pattern represents 26 weeks of treatment UDS
  pattern_char &lt;- "+++++o-------+--+-o-o-o+o+"
  
  # Replace any missing UDS ("o") with positive
  cleanPattern_char &lt;- recode_missing_visits(pattern_char)
  
  # Example: detect if the subject was able to stay clean for at least 4
  #   weeks after randomization but before the end of a 12-week observation
  #   period
  detect_subpattern(
    cleanPattern_char,
    subpattern = "----",
    end = 12
  )
  
  # Example: detect if the subject was abstinent during the last 3 weeks
  detect_subpattern(
    cleanPattern_char,
    subpattern = "---",
    start = -3, 
    end = -1
  )
