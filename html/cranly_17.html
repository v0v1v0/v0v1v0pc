<h2>cranly: CRAN package database analytics and visualizations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">cranly</span> provides core visualizations and summaries for the
CRAN package database. The package provides comprehensive methods
for cleaning up and organizing the information in the CRAN package
database, for building package directives networks (depends,
imports, suggests, enhances, linking to) and collaboration
networks, and for computing summaries and producing interactive
visualizations from the resulting networks. Network visualization
is through the <span class="pkg">visNetwork</span>
(<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visNetwork">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visNetwork</a>) package. The
package also provides functions to coerce the networks to
<span class="pkg">igraph</span> <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph</a> objects
for further analyses and modelling.
