<h2>detect_groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to perform the initial stage in detecting coordinated behavior.
It identifies pairs of accounts that share the same objects in a time_window.
See details.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">detect_groups(
  x,
  time_window = 10,
  min_participation = 2,
  remove_loops = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.table with the columns: <code>object_id</code> (uniquely identifies
coordinated content), <code>account_id</code> (unique ids for accounts), <code>content_id</code>
(id of account generated content), <code>timestamp_share</code> (integer). See also
reshape_tweets and prep_data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_window</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of seconds within which shared contents
are to be considered as coordinated (default to 10 seconds).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_participation</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum number of actions required for a account
to be included in subsequent analysis (default set at 2). This ensures that
only accounts with a minimum level of activity in the original dataset are
included in subsequent analysis. It is important to distinguish this from the
frequency of repeated interactions an account has with another specific account,
as represented by edge weight. The edge weight parameter is utilized in the
<code>generate_coordinated_network</code> function as a concluding step in identifying
coordinated behavior.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>remove_loops</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should loops (shares of the same objects made by the same
account within the time window) be removed? (default to TRUE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>keyword arguments for backwards compatibility.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function achieves the initial stage in detecting coordinated
behavior by identifying accounts who share identical objects within the same
temporal window, and is preliminary to the network analysis conducted using
the generate_coordinated_network function.
<code>detect_groups</code> groups the data by <code>object_id</code> (uniquely identifies
content) and calculates the time differences between all
<code>content_id</code> (ids of account generated contents) within their groups.
It then filters out all <code>content_id</code> that are higher than the <code>time_window</code>
(in seconds). It returns a <code>data.table</code> with all IDs of coordinated
contents. The <code>object_id</code> can be for example: hashtags, IDs of tweets being
retweeted, or URLs being shared. For twitter data, best use reshape_tweets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data.table with ids of coordinated contents. Columns:
<code>object_id</code>, <code>account_id</code>, <code>account_id_y</code>, <code>content_id</code>, <code>content_id_y</code>,
<code>timedelta</code>. The <code>account_id</code> and <code>content_id</code> represent the "older"
data points, <code>account_id_y</code> and <code>content_id_y</code> represent the "newer"
data points. For example, account A retweets from account B, then account A's
content is newer (i.e., <code>account_id_y</code>).
