<h2>Curve Difference</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the area difference between two rank abundance
curves. There are three ways differences can be calculated. 1) Between all
treatments within a block (note: block.var and treatment.var need to be
specified. 2) Between treatments, pooling all replicates into a single
species pool (note: pool = TRUE, treatment.var needs to be specified, and
block.var = NULL. 3) All pairwise combinations between all replicates
(note:block.var = NULL, pool = FALSE and specifying treatment.var is
optional. If treatment.var is specified, the treatment that each replicate
belongs to will also be listed in the output).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">curve_difference(
  df,
  time.var = NULL,
  species.var,
  abundance.var,
  replicate.var,
  treatment.var = NULL,
  pool = FALSE,
  block.var = NULL,
  reference.treatment = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing a species, abundance, and replicate columns
and optional time, treatment, and block columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the optional time column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>species.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the species column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>abundance.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the abundance column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replicate.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the replicate column. Replicate identifiers
must be unique within the dataset and cannot be nested within treatments or
blocks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the optional treatment column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pool</code></td>
<td>
<p>An argument to allow abundance values to be pooled within a
treatment. The default value is "FALSE", a value of "TRUE" averages
abundance of each species within a treatment at a given time point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>block.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the optional block column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference.treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the optional treatment that all other
treatments will be compared to (e.g. only controls will be compared to all
other treatments). If not specified all pairwise treatment comparisons will
be made.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The curve_difference function returns a data frame with the following attributes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>curve_diff: A numeric column of the area difference in curves between the two samples being compared (replicates or treatments).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replicate.var: A column that has same name and type as the replicate.var column, represents the first replicate being compared. Note, a replicate column will be returned only when pool is FALSE or block.var = NULL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replicate.var2: A column that has the same type as the replicate.var column, and is named replicate.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the second replicate being compared. Note, a replicate.var column will be returned only when pool is FALSE and block.var = NULL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time.var: A column that has the same name and type as the time.var column, if time.var is specified.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>treatment.var: A column that has same name and type as the treatment.var column, represents the first treatment being compared. A treatment.var column will be returned when pool is TRUE or block.var is specified, or treatment.var is specified.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>treatment.var2: A column that has the same type as the treatment.var column, and is named treatment.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the second treatment being compared. A treatment.var column will be returned when pool is TRUE or block.var is specified, or treatment.var is specified.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>block.var: A column that has same name and type as the block.var column, if block.var is specified.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
