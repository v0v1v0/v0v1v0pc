which the files are displayed in the folder).In this step,the missing values
of factor loading matrices from the original study stored in multiple xlsx files
will be set the value of 0.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is mainly used to read xlsx files from a folder into R.
In this process,the missing values in the xlsx files(or txt file,or csv files)
will be set to 0.The options of the "type" parameter can be "xlsx", "txt",
"csv".It should be noted that the folder containing data files should be in
current workspace.If it is not in the current workspace, the setwd() function
needs to be used to set its path.An important point is that all files in your
folder should use the same format, for instance, all of them are the xlsx
files(or txt files,or csv files).
</p>
<p>The default "manual" parameter of this function is FALSE.When the "manual" is
TRUE, the function will not automatically read files. you will need to choose
other ways to manually input the data and put them in a list to ensure that
the subsequent functions of 'coefa' can work. You can get more information
about functions in the readme and vignettes in this package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list containing all factor loading matrices without NA.
