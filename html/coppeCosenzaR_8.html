<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This class represents extends the Aggregation.matrix S4 and is the default
aggregation matrix, that presents a zero value, when the option does not
provide an adequate level of the required factor.  In other words, if the
option level is below the required one, the evaluation of the criteria for
the studied option will be zero. Such matrix provides a low compensatory
effect. Nevertheless for problems which allows greater compensatory effects,
the package allows using different aggregation matrices.
