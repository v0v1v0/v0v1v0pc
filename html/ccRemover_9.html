<h2> Single-Cell RNA-Seq data from differentiating T-helper cells</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data contains expression levels (log-transformed normalized count values)
for 81 cells and 14,147 genes. The data was normalized using ERCC spike-ins. This
data was generated by Mahata, B. et al (2014). The processed data was retrieved from
the supplementary material of Buettner et al. (2015), for descriptions of how the data was
processed, please refer to their paper.
