<h2>Number of drinks consumed in the past week</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this is not a function.
</p>
<p>This is a continuous variable derived by Statistics Canada that quantifies
the amount of alcohol that is consumed in a week. This is calculated by
adding the number of drinks consumed each day in the past week.
Respondents of each CCHS cycle are asked how much alcohol they have
consumed each day in the past week (ie. how much alcohol did you consume on
Sunday, how much did you consume on Monday etc.). Each day is considered an
individual variable and ALWDWKY takes the sum of all daily variables.
