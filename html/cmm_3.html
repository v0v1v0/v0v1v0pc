<h2>Change in antisemitism after seeing a movie</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A classical data set that has been used several times in the past, but not analyzed by means
of the methods advocated in this book (Glock, 1955; Campbell &amp; Clayton, 1961; Hagenaars, 1990,
pp. 215-233, and Hagenaars, 1990, Section 5.3). The data are from a panel study among 503
white Christians living in and around Baltimore. The study's purpose was to determine the
effect of seeing the film ‘Gentleman’s Agreement' on reducing the level of antisemitism
(Glock, 1955, p. 243). Antisemitism was measured in November 1947 (variable <code class="reqn">A</code>) prior to the
movie being locally shown and consisted of three categories : 1 = high, 2 = moderate, and
3 = low. Antisemitism was measured again in May 1948 (variable <code class="reqn">B</code>). In addition, the respondents
were asked whether or not they had (voluntary) seen the movie, which had been shown in Baltimore
theaters during the period between the two interviews (variable <code class="reqn">X</code>). The experimental group (with
<code class="reqn">X=1</code>) consisted of those respondents who saw the movie; the control group (with <code class="reqn">X=2</code>)
consisted of those who did not. The data are tabulated in Bergsma, Croon, and Hagenaars (2009, Table 5.8).

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Antisemitism)

## Sample marginal distributions

## Models for table XR given T
