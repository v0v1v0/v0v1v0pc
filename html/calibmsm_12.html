<h3>Format</h3>



<h4>'tp.cmprsk.j0'</h4>

<p>A data frame with 2,279 rows and 13 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient indentifier</p>
</dd>
<dt>pstate1, pstate2, pstate3, pstate4, pstate5, pstate6</dt>
<dd>
<p>Predicted transition probabilities of transitions into states 1 to 6</p>
</dd>
<dt>se1, se2, se3, se4, se5, se6</dt>
<dd>
<p>Standard error of the predicted transition probabilities of transitions into states 1 to 6</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data frame containing the predicted transition probabilities out of state j = 1
made at time s = 0, for a competing risks model out of the initial state (see <code>msebmtcal.cmprsk</code>).
The predicted transition probabilities were estimated by fitting
a competing risks model to the <code>msebmtcal.cmprsk</code> data using a leave-one-out approach.
Code for deriving this dataset is provided in the source code for <code>calibmsm</code>. Code for the derivation
of this dataset is provided in the source code for the package.

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>This dataset was derived from data made available within the <code>mstate</code> package, see <code>ebmt4</code>.
The data was originally provided by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (https://www.ebmt.org/).
We reiterate the source statement given by the developers of <code>mstate</code>:
