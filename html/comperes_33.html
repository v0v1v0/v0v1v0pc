<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for competition results with games between two players.

<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Pairgames is a term for competition results with games between two
players.
</p>
<p><code>to_pairgames()</code> is a function that converts competition results into
pairwise games: it drops games with one player and for every game with 3 and
more players this function transforms it into set of separate games between
unordered pairs of players. In other words the result is a set of unordered
matchups (<strong>as different games</strong>) between different
players.
</p>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> New game identifiers are integers, order of which respects order of
games stored in <code>cr_data</code> (based on first occurrence in long format). There
is no particular order in subgames of games with 3 and more players.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Order in which players are assigned to <code>player1</code> or <code>player2</code> column in
general shouldn't agree with any order in <code>cr_data</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Any column except <code>game</code>, <code>player</code> and <code>score</code> will be dropped after
conversion to longcr.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>NA</code> and <code>NaN</code> in <code>players</code> are allowed. They are treated as different
players.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>to_pairgames()</code> is rather compute-intensive and can take much time for
competition results with many games.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>to_pairgames()</code> returns a competition results of pairwise games as
widecr object with two players.
</p>
<p><code>is_pairgames()</code> returns a boolean value of whether <code>cr_data</code> contains only
games between two players.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cr_data &lt;- data.frame(
  game = c(rep(1:5, each = 3), 6),
  player = c(rep(1:5, times = 3), 1),
  score = 101:116,
  extraCol = -(1:16)
)

to_pairgames(cr_data)

# Missing values
cr_data_na &lt;- data.frame(
  game = rep(1L, 3),
  player = c(1, NA, NA),
  score = 1:3
)
to_pairgames(cr_data_na)
