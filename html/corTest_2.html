A BioConductor ExpressionSet Object Storing Gene Expression Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A BioConductor ExpressionSet object storing gene expression data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("es")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The expression data are stored in a matrix, which contains
55 row genes and 110 column subjects.
</p>
<p>The phenotye data contains two variables: <code>sid</code> (subject ID)
and <code>grp</code> (case-control status). <code>grp=1</code> indicates the subject
is a case. <code>grp=0</code> indicates the subject is a control.
</p>
<p>The feature data contains two variables: <code>geneid</code> (gene ID) and <code>memGenes</code>. <code>memGenes=1</code> indicates the gene is differentially correlated between cases and controls with
at least one other gene. <code>memGenes=0</code> indicates the gene is not diffferentially correlated with other genes.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data contains 50 cases and 60 controls. The first 5 genes are differentially correlated with at least one other genes, while the remaining 50 genes are non-differentially correlated with other genes.
</p>
<p>The covariance matrix of the first 5 genes in cases were generated by the function <code>rcorrmatrix</code> in R package <code>clusterGeneration</code>. The covariance matrix of the first 5 genes in controls are identical matrix.
</p>
<p>The covariance matrix of the remaining 50 genes in cases
were generated by the function <code>rcorrmatrix</code>. The covariance matrix of the 50 genes in controls were the same as that in cases.
</p>
<p>The first 50 subjects are cases. The remaining 60 subjects are controls.
</p>
