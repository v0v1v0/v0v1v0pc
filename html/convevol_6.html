<h2>Calculates the C1-C4 measures of convergent evolution between two lineages as described in
Stayton (2015). All measures quantify convergence by the ratio of current to maximum past phenotypic
distance between lineages. Can be used as-is but more often will be used within the calcConv script.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>calcCs calculates values of C1-C4, all of which are fundamentally based on comparing the
current phenotypic distance between two tips to the maximum past distances between the ancestors of
those tips. Higher values indicate a greater amount of past phenotypic distance which has been "closed"
by subsequent evolution, and thus greater convergence. C1 is the ratio of tip to maximum ancestral
distance. C2 is the difference of those two values. C3 scales C2 by the total amount of evolution that
has occured in the two lineages. C4 scales C2 by the total amount of evolution that has occurred in the
entire phylogeny. The arguments for this function will usually be obtained from the calcConv script in
convevol - this allows certain computationally-intensive steps (e.g., calculating ancestral states) to
only be performed once, thus saving a great deal of time. This script also corrects an error in the
calculation of C4 of previous versions of convevol.
