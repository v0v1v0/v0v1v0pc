<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data2</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional data frame. If specified, all pair-wise correlations
between the variables in <code>data</code> and <code>data2</code> will be computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>select, select2</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Ignored if <code>data2</code> is specified.) Optional names
of variables that should be selected for correlation. Instead of providing
the data frames with those variables that should be correlated, <code>data</code>
can be a data frame and <code>select</code> and <code>select2</code> are (quoted) names
of variables (columns) in <code>data</code>. <code>correlation()</code> will then
compute the correlation between <code>data[select]</code> and
<code>data[select2]</code>. If only <code>select</code> is specified, all pairwise
correlations between the <code>select</code> variables will be computed. This is
a "pipe-friendly" alternative way of using <code>correlation()</code> (see
'Examples').</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rename</code></td>
<td>
<p>In case you wish to change the names of the variables in
the output, these arguments can be used to specify these alternative names.
Note that the number of names should be equal to the number of columns
selected. Ignored if <code>data2</code> is specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string indicating which correlation coefficient is
to be used for the test. One of <code>"pearson"</code> (default),
<code>"kendall"</code>, <code>"spearman"</code> (but see also the <code>robust</code> argument), <code>"biserial"</code>,
<code>"polychoric"</code>, <code>"tetrachoric"</code>, <code>"biweight"</code>,
<code>"distance"</code>, <code>"percentage"</code> (for percentage bend correlation),

Hoeffding's D), <code>"gamma"</code>, <code>"gaussian"</code> (for Gaussian Rank
correlation) or <code>"shepherd"</code> (for Shepherd's Pi correlation). Setting
<code>"auto"</code> will attempt at selecting the most relevant method
(polychoric when ordinal factors involved, tetrachoric when dichotomous
factors involved, point-biserial if one dichotomous and one continuous and
pearson otherwise). See below the <strong>details</strong> section for a description of
these indices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<code>"ultrawide"</code>. These correspond to scale values of <code>1/sqrt(27)</code>,
<code>1/3</code>, <code>1/sqrt(3)</code> and <code>1</code>, respectively. See the
<code>BayesFactor::correlationBF</code> function.</p>

<p>Should the data include redundant rows (where each given
correlation is repeated two times).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the factors are kept and eventually
converted to numeric or used as random effects (depending of

<p>If partial correlations under a Bayesian framework
are needed, you will also need to set <code>partial_bayesian</code> to <code>TRUE</code> to
obtain "full" Bayesian partial correlations. Otherwise, you will obtain
pseudo-Bayesian partial correlations (i.e., Bayesian correlation based on
frequentist partialization).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>multilevel</code></td>

<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the factors are included as random factors.
Else, if <code>FALSE</code> (default), they are included as fixed effects in the
simple regression model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ranktransform</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, will rank-transform the variables prior to
estimating the correlation, which is one way of making the analysis more
resistant to extreme values (outliers). Note that, for instance, a Pearson's
correlation on rank-transformed data is equivalent to a Spearman's rank
correlation. Thus, using <code>robust=TRUE</code> and <code>method="spearman"</code> is
redundant. Nonetheless, it is an easy option to increase the robustness of the
correlation as well as flexible way to obtain Bayesian or multilevel
Spearman-like rank correlations.</p>
</td>

<p>Another way of making the correlation more "robust" (i.e.,
limiting the impact of extreme values). Can be either <code>FALSE</code> or a

<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Correlation Types</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Pearson's correlation</strong>: This is the most common correlation
method. It corresponds to the covariance of the two variables normalized
(i.e., divided) by the product of their standard deviations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Spearman's rank correlation</strong>: A non-parametric measure of rank
correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables).
The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson
correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's
correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses
monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). Confidence Intervals (CI)
for Spearman's correlations are computed using the Fieller et al. (1957)
correction (see Bishara and Hittner, 2017).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Kendall's rank correlation</strong>: In the normal case, the Kendall correlation
is preferred than the Spearman correlation because of a smaller gross error
sensitivity (GES) and a smaller asymptotic variance (AV), making it more
robust and more efficient. However, the interpretation of Kendall's tau is
less direct than that of Spearman's rho, in the sense that it quantifies the
difference between the percentage of concordant and discordant pairs among
all possible pairwise events. Confidence Intervals (CI) for Kendall's
correlations are computed using the Fieller et al. (1957) correction (see
Bishara and Hittner, 2017).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Biweight midcorrelation</strong>: A measure of similarity that is
median-based, instead of the traditional mean-based, thus being less
sensitive to outliers. It can be used as a robust alternative to other
similarity metrics, such as Pearson correlation (Langfelder &amp; Horvath,
2012).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Distance correlation</strong>: Distance correlation measures both
linear and non-linear association between two random variables or random
vectors. This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect
linear association between two random variables.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Percentage bend correlation</strong>: Introduced by Wilcox (1994), it
is based on a down-weight of a specified percentage of marginal observations
deviating from the median (by default, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠20%⁠</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Shepherd's Pi correlation</strong>: Equivalent to a Spearman's rank
correlation after outliers removal (by means of bootstrapped Mahalanobis
distance).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Blomqvist’s coefficient</strong>: The Blomqvist’s coefficient (also
referred to as Blomqvist's Beta or medial correlation; Blomqvist, 1950) is a
median-based non-parametric correlation that has some advantages over
measures such as Spearman's or Kendall's estimates (see Shmid &amp; Schimdt,
2006).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Hoeffding’s D</strong>: The Hoeffding’s D statistics is a
non-parametric rank based measure of association that detects more general
departures from independence (Hoeffding 1948), including non-linear
associations. Hoeffding’s D varies between -0.5 and 1 (if there are no tied
ranks, otherwise it can have lower values), with larger values indicating a
stronger relationship between the variables.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Somers’ D</strong>: The Somers’ D statistics is a non-parametric rank
based measure of association between a binary variable and a continuous
variable, for instance, in the context of logistic regression the binary
outcome and the predicted probabilities for each outcome. Usually, Somers' D
is a measure of ordinal association, however, this implementation it is
limited to the case of a binary outcome.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Point-Biserial and biserial correlation</strong>: Correlation
coefficient used when one variable is continuous and the other is dichotomous
(binary). Point-Biserial is equivalent to a Pearson's correlation, while
Biserial should be used when the binary variable is assumed to have an
underlying continuity. For example, anxiety level can be measured on a
continuous scale, but can be classified dichotomously as high/low.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Gamma correlation</strong>: The Goodman-Kruskal gamma statistic is
similar to Kendall's Tau coefficient. It is relatively robust to outliers and
deals well with data that have many ties.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Winsorized correlation</strong>: Correlation of variables that have
been formerly Winsorized, i.e., transformed by limiting extreme values to
reduce the effect of possibly spurious outliers.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Gaussian rank Correlation</strong>: The Gaussian rank correlation
estimator is a simple and well-performing alternative for robust rank
correlations (Boudt et al., 2012). It is based on the Gaussian quantiles of
the ranks.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Polychoric correlation</strong>: Correlation between two theorized
normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed ordinal
variables.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Tetrachoric correlation</strong>: Special case of the polychoric
correlation applicable when both observed variables are dichotomous.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Partial Correlation</h4>

<p><strong>Partial correlations</strong> are estimated as the correlation between two
variables after adjusting for the (linear) effect of one or more other
variable. The correlation test is then run after having partialized the
dataset, independently from it. In other words, it considers partialization
as an independent step generating a different dataset, rather than belonging
to the same model. This is why some discrepancies are to be expected for the
t- and p-values, CIs, BFs etc (but <em>not</em> the correlation coefficient)
compared to other implementations (e.g., <code>ppcor</code>). (The size of these
discrepancies depends on the number of covariates partialled-out and the
strength of the linear association between all variables.) Such partial
correlations can be represented as Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM), an
increasingly popular tool in psychology. A GGM traditionally include a set of
variables depicted as circles ("nodes"), and a set of lines that visualize
relationships between them, which thickness represents the strength of
association (see Bhushan et al., 2019).
</p>
<p><strong>Multilevel correlations</strong> are a special case of partial correlations where
the variable to be adjusted for is a factor and is included as a random
effect in a mixed model (note that the remaining continuous variables of the
dataset will still be included as fixed effects, similarly to regular partial
correlations). The model is a random intercept model, i.e. the multilevel
correlation is adjusted for <code>(1 | groupfactor)</code>.That said, there is an
important difference between using <code>cor_test()</code> and <code>correlation()</code>: If you
set <code>multilevel=TRUE</code> in <code>correlation()</code> but <code>partial</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code> (as
per default), then a back-transformation from partial to non-partial
correlation will be attempted (through <code>pcor_to_cor()</code>).
However, this is not possible when using <code>cor_test()</code> so that if you set
<code>multilevel=TRUE</code> in it, the resulting correlations are partial one. Note
that for Bayesian multilevel correlations, if <code>partial = FALSE</code>, the back
transformation will also recompute <em>p</em>-values based on the new <em>r</em> scores,
and will drop the Bayes factors (as they are not relevant anymore). To keep
Bayesian scores, set <code>partial = TRUE</code>.
</p>



<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Kendall and Spearman correlations when <code>bayesian=TRUE</code>: These are technically
Pearson Bayesian correlations of rank transformed data, rather than pure
Bayesian rank correlations (which have different priors).
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A correlation object that can be displayed using the <code>print</code>, <code>summary</code> or
<code>table</code> methods.
</p>


<h4>Multiple tests correction</h4>

<p>The <code>p_adjust</code> argument can be used to adjust p-values for multiple
comparisons. All adjustment methods available in <code>p.adjust</code> function
<code>stats</code> package are supported.
