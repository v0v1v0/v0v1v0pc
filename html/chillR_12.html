<h2>Convert a weather file downloaded from the Chilean Agromet website to chillR
format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert downloaded weather data into a data frame that makes running other
chillR functions easy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">chile_agromet2chillR(downloaded_weather_file, drop_most = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>downloaded_weather_file</code></td>
<td>
<p>full path of a weather file downloaded from
the <a href="https://agromet.inia.cl/">Chilean Agromet website</a> as an alleged Excel
file (it has some formatting issues).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop_most</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating if most columns should be
dropped from the file. If set to TRUE (default), only essential columns for
running chillR functions are retained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Processing the data with this function will make the data work well with the
remainder of this package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data.frame with weather data, according to the downloaded file
provided as input. If drop_most is FALSE, all columns from the original
dataset are preserved, although some column names are adjusted to chillR's
preferences ("Year","Month","Day","Tmin","Tmax","Tmean","Prec", if these
columns are present). If drop_most is TRUE, only columns likely to be of
interest to chillR users are retained.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Many databases have data quality flags, which may sometimes indicate
that data aren't reliable. These are not considered by this function!
