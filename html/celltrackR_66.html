<h2>Process Tracks Containing Gaps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Many common motility analyses, such as mean square displacement plots, assume that
object positions are recorded at constant time intervals. For some application domains,
such as intravital imaging, this may not always be the case. This function can be
used to pre-process data imaged at nonconstant intervals, provided the deviations are
not too extreme.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">repairGaps(x, how = "split", tol = 0.05, split.min.length = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the input tracks object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>how</code></td>
<td>
<p>string specifying what do with tracks that contain gaps. Possible
values are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "drop": the simplest option â€“ discard all tracks that contain gaps.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "split":  split tracks around the gaps, e.g. a track for which the step
between the 3rd and 4th positions is too long or too short is split into one
track corresponding to positions 1 to 3 and another track corresponding to
position 3 onwards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "interpolate":  approximate the track positions using linear
interpolation (see <code>interpolateTrack</code>). The result is a tracks
object with constant step durations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>nonnegative number specifying by which fraction each step may deviate
from the average step duration without being considered a gap. For instance, if
the average step duration (see <code>timeStep</code>) is 100 seconds and <code>tol</code>
is 0.05 (the default), then step durations between 95 and 105 seconds (both inclusive)
are not considered gaps. This option is ignored for <code>how="interpolate"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>split.min.length</code></td>
<td>
<p>nonnegative integer. For <code>how="split"</code>, this
discards all resulting tracks shorter than
this many positions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tracks</code> object with gaps fixed according to the chosen method.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## The Neutrophil data are imaged at rather nonconstant intervals
print( length( Neutrophils ) )
print( length( repairGaps( Neutrophils, tol=0.01 ) ) )

</code></pre>
