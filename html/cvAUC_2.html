<h2>Data set: Simulated Pooled Repeated Measures Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simulated pooled repeated measures data set of patient medication adherence summaries with a binary outcome.  The independent units are the patients, and each patient has one or more measurements made at different time points in treatment, each associated with a binary outcome that could represent a diagnostic test result.  This data set is meant to be used with the <code>ci.pooled.cvAUC</code> function.
