<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This derived variable is generated in CCHS cycles 2003-2014. The
2001 CCHS cycle, however, contains the same base variables used to derive
this variable. To include respondents in the 2001 CCHS cycle, this custom
function was created using the same derivation conditions used in later
cycles.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Using RACDPAL_fun() to transform RACDPAL in 2001. 
# RACDPAL_fun() is specified in variable_details.csv along with the
# CCHS variables and cycles included.
 
# To transform RACDPAL, use rec_with_table() for each the 2001 cycle
# and specify RACDPAL, along with the various ADL variables.

# Note: In other CCHS cycles you only need to specify RACDPAL as the variable
# was included in those survey cycles.

# Using RACDPAL_fun() with user inputted data.

# Let's say you're an individual that sometimes has difficulties with
# activities due to disability, sometimes has a reduction in activities at
# home, often has a reduction at school or work, and never has a reduction
# in other activities. Your participation and activity limitation can be
# determined as follows:

RACDPAL &lt;- RACDPAL_fun(1, 1, 2, 3)
print(RACDPAL)
