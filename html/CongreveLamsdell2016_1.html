<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each of the 100 matrices generated by Congreve &amp; Lamsdell (2016), I conducted
phylogenetic analysis under different methods:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>Mkv</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>using the Markov K model in MrBayes;</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>eq</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>using equal weights in TNT;</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, <code>k3</code>, <code>k5</code>, <code>kX</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>using implied weights in TNT,
with the concavity constant (<em>k</em>) set to 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10;</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>kC</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>by taking the strict <em>c</em>onsensus of all trees recovered by implied
weights parsimony analysis under the <em>k</em> values 2, 3, 5 and 10 (but not 1).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For each analysis, I recorded the strict consensus of all optimal trees, and
also the consensus of trees that were suboptimal by a specified degree.
</p>
<p>I then calculated, of the total number of quartets or partitions that were
resolved in the reference tree, how many were the <em>s</em>ame or <em>d</em>ifferent in
the tree that resulted from the phylogenetic analysis, and how many were
not resolved in this tree (<em>r2</em>).
</p>
<p>The data object contains a list whose elements are named after the methods,
as listed above.
</p>
<p>Each list entry is a three-dimensional array, whose dimensions are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>  The suboptimality of the tree.  Different measures of node
support are employed:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>     * `Mkv`: Posterior probabilities, at 2.5\% intervals (50\%, 52.5\%, ...
      97.5\%, 100\%).

     * `Brem`: Bremer supports: the consensus of all trees that are
       (equal weights) 0, 1, .... 19, 20 steps less optimal than the optimal
       tree (implied weights: the consensus of all trees that are 0.73^(19:0)
       less optimal than the optimal tree).

     * `Boot`: Bootstrap supports (symmetric resampling, _p_ = 0.33).

     * `Jack`: Jackknife supports (_p_ = 0.36).

       `Boot` and `Jack` results are reported both as the `freq`uency of splits
       among replicates, and using the `gc` (Groups Present / Contradicted)
       measure (Goloboff _et al_. 2003); frequency columns correspond to
       100\%, 97.5\%, 95\% ... 0\% support; gc columns correspond to 100\%, 95\%,
       ... 0\% present, 5\%, 10\%, ... 100\% contradicted.
</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Counts of the condition of each quartet or partition:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>  * `Q`: The total number of quartets defined on 22 taxa.

  * `N`: The total number of partitions present, counting each tree separately.

  * `P1`: The number of partitions in tree 1 (the reconstructed tree).

  * `P2`: The number of partitions in tree 2 (the generative tree).

  * `s`: The number of quartets or partitions resolved identically in
         each tree.
  * `d`: The number of quartets resolved differently in each tree.

  * `d1`: The number of partitions resolved in tree 1, but contradicted by
          tree 2.

  * `d2`: The number of partitions resolved in tree 2, but contradicted by
          tree 1.

  * `r1`: The number of partitions or quartets resolved in tree 1 that are
          neither present in nor contradicted by tree 2.

  * `r2`: The number of partitions or quartets resolved in tree 2 that are
          neither present in nor contradicted by tree 1.

  * `u`: The number of quartets that are not resolved in either tree.
</pre></div>
