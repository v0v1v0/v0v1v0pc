<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A metabolomic map of Zellweger spectrum disorders reveals 
novel disease biomarkers. Global metabolic profiling obtained by 
untargetedmass spectrometry-based metabolomic platform for the 
detectionof novel and known inborn errors of metabolism.  This 
untargeted approach collected z-score values for &gt;650 unique compounds 
fromhuman plasma.  Data set contains 19 individual plasma samples with
confirmed biallelic pathogenic variants in the PEX1 gene. These 
samples revealed elevations in pipecolic acid and long-chain
lysophosphatidylcholines, as well as an unanticipated reduction
in multiple sphingomyelin species.
