<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the 2007-2014 CCHS survey cycles, occupation group has 5
categories. The categories are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Management, Health, Education, Art, Culture
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Business, Finance, Admin
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Sales or Service
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Trades, Transport or Equipment Operator
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Unique to Primary Industry/Processing/Manufacturing
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this variable, categories from the 2001 CCHS survey cycle were collapsed
to harmonize with the other survey cycles. "Management, Professional
(including accountants), Technologist, Technician or Tech Occupation" were
combined into one category "Management, Health, Education, Art, Culture".
"Farming, Forestry, Fishing, Mining" and "Processing, Manufacturing,
Utilities", were combined into one category "Farming, Forestry, Fishing,
Mining, Processing, Manufacturing, Utilities".  
</p>
<p>The "other" category in the 2001 CCHS survey cycle was assigned to missing
(NA(b)). This is consistent with other studies 
(doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/IJCIIS.IJCIIS_43_18">10.4103/IJCIIS.IJCIIS_43_18</a>)
that group the "other" category as "missing". <code>LBFA_31A_b</code>
is a 6 category variable that keeps the "other" category in the 2001 survey
cycle as "other".
