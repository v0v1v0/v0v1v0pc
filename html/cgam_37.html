<h2>Specify a Tree-Ordering in a CGAM Formula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A symbolic routine to define that the systematic component <code class="reqn">\eta</code> has a tree-ordering in a predictor in a formula argument to cgam.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tree(x, pl = NULL)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector which has the same length as the response vector. Note that the placebo level of x must be 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pl</code></td>
<td>
<p>The placebo level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>"tree" returns the vector "x" and imposes on it two attributes: name and shape. 
</p>
<p>The name attribute is used in the subroutine plotpersp; the shape attribute is "tree", and according to the value of the vector itself and its shape attribute, the cone edges of the cone generated by the constraint matrix, which constrains that <code class="reqn">\eta</code> has a tree-ordering in "x"  will be made. The cone edges are a set of basis employed in the hinge algorithm. 
</p>
<p>Note that "tree" does not make the corresponding cone edges itself. It sets things up to a sub-routine called tree.fun in cgam which will make the cone edges. A tree-ordering is a partial ordering: For a categorical variable <code class="reqn">x</code>, if there are treatment levels <code class="reqn">x_1,\ldots,x_k</code>, where <code class="reqn">x_1</code> is a placebo, we compare <code class="reqn">x_i, i = 2,\ldots,k</code> with <code class="reqn">x_1</code>, and not have any other comparable pairs.

<h3>Value</h3>
