<h2>European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation data (one row per individual)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame of 2,279 individuals with blood cancer who have undergone a transplant.
This data is identical to the <code>ebmt4</code> data, except two extra variables have
been derived, time until censoring and a censoring indicator, which are required
to assess calibration using some of the methods in <code>calibmsm</code>. Code for the derivation
of this dataset is provided in the source code for the package.
</p>
