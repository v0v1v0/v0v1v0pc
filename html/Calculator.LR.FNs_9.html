messages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this function is supporting the functions of this package (by introducing some nested "if-else" conditions) from all possible messages which are defined in functions of this package.
The "messages" function is used in most of functions of this package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">messages(M)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M</code></td>
<td>

<p>A L, LR or RL fuzzy number
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Some special messages like: "NOT additive", "NOT productive", .... If any message is not necessary for this function, then the value 1 will be return by this function which is used in the text and the body of other functions.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function has not any applications for users of package and it considered only for shortening the length of programming.
