<h2>Scaled sum coding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contrast coding scheme with a centered intercept and comparisons
from a baseline reference level.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">scaled_sum_code(n)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer umber of factor levels to compute contrasts for.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The name for this contrast scheme varies widely in different fields
and across experimental psychology papers. It has been called simple, sum,
contrast, sum-to-zero, and deviation coding (among other names). This package
uses scaled sum coding to explicitly differentiate it from sum coding, which
has an implementation in base R with <code>contr.sum</code>.
</p>
<p>For n levels of factors, generate a matrix with n-1 comparisons where:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Reference level = -1/n
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Comparison level = (n-1)/n
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All others = -1/n
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example interpretation for a 4 level factor:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Intercept = Grand mean (mean of the means of each level)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> grp2 = mean(grp2) - mean(grp1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> grp3 = mean(grp3) - mean(grp1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> grp4 = mean(grp4) - mean(grp1)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: grp coefficient estimates are the same as with contr.treatment, but the
intercept is changed to the grand mean instead of the mean of grp1.
</p>
<p>It's also important to note that this coding scheme is NOT the same as
<code>contr.sum/2</code> when the number of levels is greater than 2. When n=2,
estimates with <code>contr.sum</code> can be interpreted as "half the distance between
levels" but when k&gt;2, <code>contr.sum</code> is to be interpreted as "the distance
between this level and the GRAND MEAN". You may be tempted to use
<code>contr.sum(n)/2</code>, but this tests the hypothesis that 3/2 times the mean of a
level is equal to half the sum of the means of the other levels, i.e.,
<code class="reqn">1.5\mu_1 - .5\mu_2 - .5\mu_3 - .5\mu_4 = 0</code>, which is not likely to be
what you're looking for.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A contrast matrix with dimensions n rows and (n-1) columns.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Compare these two, note that contr.sum(4)/2 is not the same
scaled_sum_code(4)
contr.sum(4)

# Here they happen to be equivalent (modulo reference level)
scaled_sum_code(2)
contr.sum(2) / 2

mydf &lt;- data.frame(
  grp = gl(4,5),
  resp = c(seq(1, 5), seq(5, 9), seq(10, 14), seq(15, 19))
)

mydf &lt;- set_contrasts(mydf, grp ~ scaled_sum_code)

lm(resp ~ grp, data = mydf)
