<h2>Variable and Shape Selection via Genetic Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The partial linear generalized additive model is considered, where the goal is to choose a subset of predictor variables and describe the component relationships with the response, in the case where there is very little <em>a priori</em> information. For each predictor, the user need only specify a set of possible shape or order restrictions. A model selection method chooses the shapes and orderings of the relationships as well as the variables.  For each possible combination of shapes and orders for the predictors, the maximum likelihood estimator for the constrained generalized additive model is found using iteratively re-weighted cone projections.  The cone information criterion is used to select the best combination of variables and shapes.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ShapeSelect(formula, family = gaussian, cpar = 2, data = NULL, weights = NULL, 
npop = 200, per.mutate = 0.05, genetic = FALSE)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>

<p>A formula object which includes a set of predictors to be selected. It has the form "response ~ predictor". The response is a vector of length <code class="reqn">n</code>. The specification of the model can be one of the three exponential families: gaussian, binomial and poisson. The systematic component <code class="reqn">\eta</code> is <code class="reqn">E(y)</code>, the log odds of <code class="reqn">y = 1</code>, and the logarithm of <code class="reqn">E(y)</code> respectively. The user is supposed to define at least one predictor in the formula, which could be a non-parametrically modelled variable or a parametrically modelled covariate (categorical or linear). Assume that <code class="reqn">\eta</code> is the systematic component and <code class="reqn">x</code> is a predictor, two symbolic routines <code>shapes</code> and <code>in.or.out</code> are used to include <code class="reqn">x</code> in the formula. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>shapes(x): <code class="reqn">x</code> is included as a non-parametrically modelled predictor in the formula. See <code>shapes</code> for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in.or.out(x): <code class="reqn">x</code> is included as a categorical or linear predictor in the formula. See <code>in.or.out</code> for more details.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>family</code></td>
<td>
<p>A parameter indicating the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. It can be a character string naming a family function or the result of a call to a family function. This is borrowed from the glm routine in the stats package. There are three families used in ShapeSelect: gaussian, binomial and poisson.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cpar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A multiplier to estimate the model variance, which is defined as <code class="reqn">\sigma^2 = SSR / (n - d_0 - cpar * edf)</code>. SSR is the sum of squared residuals for the full model, <code class="reqn">d_0</code> is the dimension of the linear space in the cone, and edf is the effective degrees of freedom. The default is cpar = 2. See Meyer, M. C. and M. Woodroofe (2000) for more details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional data frame, list or environment containing the variables in the model. The default is data = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional non-negative vector of "replicate weights" which has the same length as the response vector. If weights are not given, all weights are taken to equal 1. The default is weights = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The population size used for the genetic algorithm. The default is npop = 200.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>per.mutate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The percentage of mutation used for the genetic algorithm. The default is per.mutate = 0.05</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genetic</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar showing if or not the genetic algorithm is defined by the user to select the best model. The default is genetic = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that when the argument genetic is set to be FALSE, the routine will check to see if using the genetic algorithm is better than going through all models to find the best fit. The primary concern is running time. An interactive dialogue window may pop out to ask the user if they prefer to the genetic algorithm when it may take too long to do a brutal search, and if there are too many possible models to go through, like more than one million, the routine will implement the genetic algorithm anyway.

<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>top</code></td>
<td>
<p>The best model of the final population, which shows the variables chosen along with their best shapes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The final population ordered by its fitness values. It is a data frame, and each row of this data frame shows the shapes chosen for predictors in an individual model. Besides, the fitness value for each individual model is included in the last column of the data frame. For example, we have two continuous predictors <code class="reqn">x_1</code>, <code class="reqn">x_2</code>, and a categorical predictor <code class="reqn">z</code>, then a row of this data frame may look like: "flat", "s.incr", "in", <code class="reqn">-12.3806</code>, which means that <code class="reqn">x_1</code> is not chosen, <code class="reqn">x_2</code> is chosen with the shape constraint to be smoothly increasing, <code class="reqn">z</code> is included in the model, and the fitness value for the model is <code class="reqn">-12.3806</code>.</p>
