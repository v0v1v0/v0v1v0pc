<h2>Statistical Modeling of Compound Events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools for extracting occurrences, assessing potential driving factors, predicting occurrences,
and quantifying impacts of compound events in hydrology and climatology.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Examples of compound events in hydroclimatology include, but not limited to, compound dry-hot events and compound precipitation and surge (or sea level) events. Take the compound dry and hot event as an example. The function <code>GetDH</code> is used for extracting occurrences based on thresholds of dry and hot indicators. The function <code>DriverLGR</code> is used for assessing potential driving factors of compound events based on logistic regression model. The function <code>PredLGR</code> is used for predicting occurrences of compound events. The function <code>ImpactMG</code> is used for quantifying impacts of compound dry and hot events based on meta-Gaussian model.
