<h2>Generation of Artificial Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function shows the demonstration of data generation based on some
specific and commonly used settings, including exponential family distributed
potential outcomes, error-prone treatments, and covariates. In this function,
users can specify different magnitudes of measurement error and relationship
between outcome, treatment, and covariates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Data_Gen(
  X,
  alpha,
  beta,
  theta,
  a,
  sigma_e,
  e_distr = "normal",
  num_pi,
  delta,
  linearY,
  typeY
)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input of n x p dimensional matrix of true covariates, where n is
sample size and p is number of covariates. Users can customize the data structure
and distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the parameters that reflects the relationship between
treatment model and covariates. The dimension of <code>alpha</code> should be equal to the
dimension of <code>beta</code>. If <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code> have the same nonzero
components, then we call them Xc (covariates associated with both outcome and treatment).
If components in <code>alpha</code> are zero but the same components in <code>beta</code> are
nonzero, we call them Xp (covariates associated with outcome only), If components
in <code>alpha</code> are nonzero but the same components in <code>beta</code> are zero, we
call them Xi (covariates associated with treatment only).
For example, if <code>alpha = c(2,2,0,0,1,1)</code> and <code>beta = c(3,3,1,1,0,0)</code>, then
the first two components are Xc, the middle two components are Xp, and the last two
components are Xi.</p>

<p>The scalar of the parameter used to link outcome and
treatment.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>A weight of <code>cov_e</code> in the measurement error model
W = cov_e*a + X + e, where W is observed covariates with measurement error,

<p><code>sigma_e</code> is the common diagonal entries of covariance

<td><code>e_distr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distribution of the noise term in the classical measurement
error model. The input "normal" refers to the normal distribution with mean
zero and covariance matrix with diagonal entries <code>sigma_e</code>. The scalar input "v"
represents t-distribution with degree of freedom v.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num_pi</code></td>

<p>Settings of misclassification probability with option 1 or 2.

pi_01 is not equal to pi_10.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delta</code></td>
<td>
<p>The parameter that determines number of treatment with measurement
error. <code>delta = 1</code> has equal number of treatment with and without measurement
error. We set <code>default = 0.5</code> since it has smaller number of treatment who has
measurement error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>linearY</code></td>
<td>
<p>The boolean option that determines the relationship between
outcome and covariates. <code>linearY = TRUE</code> gives linear relationship with a
vector of parameters <code>alpha</code>, <code>linearY = FALSE</code> refers to non linear
relationship between outcome and covariates, where the sin function is specified on
Xc and the exponential function is specified on Xp.</p>

<p>The outcome variable with exponential family distribution
"binary", "pois" and "cont". <code>typeY = "binary"</code> refers to binary random

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">##### Example 1: A multivariate normal continuous X with linear normal Y #####

## Generate a multivariate normal X matrix
mean_x = 0; sig_x = 1; rho = 0
Sigma_x = matrix( rho*sig_x^2,nrow=120 ,ncol=120 )
diag(Sigma_x) = sig_x^2
Mean_x = rep( mean_x, 120 )
X = as.matrix( mvrnorm(n = 60,mu = Mean_x,Sigma = Sigma_x,empirical = FALSE) )

## Data generation setting
## alpha: Xc's scale is 0.2 0.2 and Xi's scale is 0.3 0.3
## so this refers that there is 2 Xc and Xi
## beta: Xc's scale is 2 2 and Xp's scale is 2 2
## so this refers that there is 2 Xc and Xp
## rest with following setup
Data_fun &lt;- Data_Gen(X, alpha = c(0.2,0.2,0,0,0.3,0.3), beta = c(2,2,2,2,0,0)
, theta = 2, a = 2, sigma_e = 0.75, e_distr = 10, num_pi = 1, delta = 0.8,
linearY = TRUE, typeY = "cont")

##### Example 2: A uniform X with non linear binary Y #####

## Generate a uniform X matrix
n = 50; p = 120
X = matrix(NA,n,p)
for( i in 1:p ){ X[,i] = sample(runif(n,-1,1),n,replace=TRUE ) }
X = scale(X)

## Data generation setting
## alpha: Xc's scale is 0.1 and Xi's scale is 0.3
## so this refers that there is 1 Xc and Xi
## beta: Xc's scale is 2 and Xp's scale is 3
## so this refers that there is 1 Xc and Xp
## rest with following setup
Data_fun &lt;- Data_Gen(X, alpha = c(0.1,0,0.3), beta = c(2,3,0)
, theta = 1, a = 2, sigma_e = 0.5, e_distr = "normal", num_pi = 2, delta = 0.5,
