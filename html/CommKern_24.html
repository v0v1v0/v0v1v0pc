<h2>Simulated functional and structural connectivity with nested 
hierarchical community structure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing multimodal network information simulated to emulate 
functional and structural brain connectivity data with a nested hierarchical
community structure. This dataset is a list containing five components in a
format used as an input to the <code>hms</code> function. The components,
and their associated variables, are as follows:
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SBM_net
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing five components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>func_edges</dt>
<dd>
<p>a dataframe containing 1233 rows and 3 columns: func_start_node,
func_end_node, and func_weight. This dataframe describes the pairwise functional
edge weights between nodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>str_edges</dt>
<dd>
<p>a dataframe containing 453 rows and 3 columns: str_start_node,
str_end_node, and str_weight. This dataframe describes the pairwise structural
edge weights between nodes. There are fewer rows to this dataframe than func_edges
as structural connectivity tends to be sparser than functional connectivity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>vertexes</dt>
<dd>
<p>a dataframe containing 80 rows and 5 columns: node_id, node_label,
func_degree, str_degree, and community. The degree of a node is the sum of all edge
weights connected to the node. In this simulated network, node_label is left as NA
but, for other networks, a specific label may be used to denote additional information
about the node. The community variable is left blank but is used by the <code>hms</code>
algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>func_matrix</dt>
<dd>
<p>an 80 x 80 matrix in the style of a network adjacency matrix. It
contains the same information as func_edges, just in a wide, rather than long, format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>str_matrix</dt>
<dd>
<p>an 80 x 80 matrix in the style of a network adjacency matrix. It
contains the same information as str_edges, just in a wide, rather than long, format.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
