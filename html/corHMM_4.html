<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function takes a tree and a trait file and estimates transition rates and ancestral states for any number of discrete characters using a Markov model with or without "hidden" states. Users are advised to read the _Generalized corHMM_ vignette for details on how to make full use of <code>corHMM</code>'s new functionality. In general, these models describe evolution as discrete transitions between observed states. If rate.class &gt; 1, then the model is a hidden Markov model (HMM; also known as a hidden rates model (HRM)). The HRM is a generalization of the covarion model that allows different rate classes to be treated as "hidden" states. Essentially a hidden Markov model allows for multiple processes to describe the evolution of your observed character. This could be another (hidden) state or a large group of them. Regardless of the reason, an HMM is saying that not all observed characters are expected to act the same way. 
</p>
<p>The first column of the input data must be species names (as in the previous version), but there can be any number of data columns. If your dataset does have 2 or more columns of trait information, each column is taken to describe a separate character. The separation of character and state is an important one because corHMM will automatically remove dual transitions from your model. For example, say you had 3 characters each with 2 states (0 or 1), but only three of these combinations were ever observed 0_0_1, 0_1_0, or 1_0_0. With dual transitions disallowed, it is impossible to move between these combinations because it would mean simultaneously losing and gaining a state (0_0_1 -&gt; 0_0_0 -&gt; 0_1_0 in one step.) One way around this is to provide a custom rate matrix to corHMM where transitions are allowed between these states. However, this is also a case where it would seem appropriate to code the data as a single character with 3 states.
</p>
<p>Ambiguities (polymorphic taxa or taxa missing data) are assigned likelihoods following Felsenstein (2004, p. 255). Taxa with missing data are coded “?” with all states observed at a tip. Polymorphic taxa are coded with states separated by an “&amp;”. For example, if a trait has four states and taxonA is observed to be in state 1 and 3, the character would be coded as “1&amp;3”. corHMM then uses this information to assign a likelihood of 1.0 to both states. Missing data are treated as ambiguous for all states, thus all states for taxa missing data are assigned a likelihood of 1.0. For example, for a four-state character (i.e. DNA), a taxon missing data will have likelihoods of all four states equal to 1.0 [e.g. L(A)=1.0, L(C)=1.0, L(G)=1.0, L(T)=1.0].
</p>
<p>The likelihood function is maximized using the bounded subplex optimization routine implemented in the R package <code>nloptr</code>, which provides a common interface to NLopt, an open-source library for nonlinear optimization. In the former case, however, it is recommended that <code>nstarts</code> is set to a large value (e.g. 100) to ensure that the maximum likelihood solution is found. Users can set <code>n.cores</code> to parse the random restarts onto multiple processors.
</p>
<p>The user can fix the root state probabilities by supplying a vector to <code>root.p</code>. For example, if the hypothesis is that the root is 0_S in a model with two hidden rates, then the root vector would be <code>root.p=c(1,0,0,0)</code> for state combinations 0_S, 1_S, 0_F, and 1_F, respectively. If the user supplies the flag <code>root.p</code>=“NULL”, then there is equal weighting among all possible states in the  model. If the user supplies the flag <code>root.p</code>=“yang”, then the estimated transition rates are used to set the weights at the root (see pg. 124 Yang 2006), whereas specifying <code>root.p</code>=“maddfitz” employs the same procedure described by Maddison et al. (2007) and FitzJohn et al. (2009). Note that the default <code>root.p="yang"</code>.
</p>
<p>Ancestral states can be estimated using marginal, joint, scaled, or none approaches. Marginal gives the likelihood of state at each node, integrating over the states at other nodes. Joint gives the optimal state at each node for the entire tree at once (it can only return the most likely state, i.e. it is not a probability like the marginal reconstruction). Scaled is included for compatibility with ape's ace() function. None suppresses calculation of ancestral states, which can dramatically speed up calculations if you're comparing models but make plotting difficult.
