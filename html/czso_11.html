<h2>{czso} on MacOS Monterey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Explanation of how and why extra setup steps are needed to use {czso} on MacOS Monterey
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some early versions of MacOS Monterey ship with an old version of Libre SSL. This causes an otherwise rare bug where'
the certificates on CZSO servers cannot be decrypted, so R cannot communicate with the server. Because R relies on the
default system SSL library, this in fact affects even curl on the system command line.
</p>
<p>The solution in R is to put
</p>
<p><code>CURL_SSL_BACKEND=SecureTransport</code> into .Renviron. (Don't forget to add a newline if this is the last line in the file).
Setting this anywhere after R startup may not work, hence the .Renviron solution is recommended.
</p>
<p>You can also put this in your system environent e.g. by setting the system variable in the .profile file.
</p>
<p>The issue no longer exists on MacOS Monterey 12.3 Beta, so presumably will also not exist on Monterey 12.3.
