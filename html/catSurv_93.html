</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nte_cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Cat</code> of length 1.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with
2534 response profiles from MTurk,
4993 response profiles collected by Qualtrics in June 2018,
and 1512 response profiles from The American Panel Survey (TAPS) in December 2014.
TAPS is a monthly online panel survey  of about 2,000 adults in the United States.
The panel was recruited in the fall of 2011 using an address-based sampling frame.
TAPS surveys are administered online.  Selected panelists who do not have a computer or
online service are provided a computer and internet access by TAPS. 
</p>
<p>See <code>Cat-class</code> for details regarding the Cat object structure.
See <code>grmCat</code> for details regarding the graded response model.
</p>
<p>A normal prior was chosen with mean from the theta estimates from the TAPS sample (.002) and a standard deviation (1.3)
wide enough to envelope the range of estimated theta values across both samples.
</p>
<p>Note that due to how the item parameters were estimated, large, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
</p>
<p>Response options are:
</p>
<p>5 = Extremely characteristic of me, 4 = Somewhat characteristic of me, 3 = Uncertain, 2 = Somewhat uncharacteristic of me, 1 = Extremely uncharacteristic of me
