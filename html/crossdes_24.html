<h2>Construction of Williams Designs </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function constructs williams designs. Williams designs are row-column designs. They are used if 
each of the treatments in the study is given to each of the subjects. If the number of 
treatments to be tested is even, the design is a latin square, otherwise it consists of two latin squares.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">williams(trt)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trt</code></td>
<td>
<p> An integer &gt; 1, giving the number of treatments in the design. </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resulting design is a (generalized) latin square that is also balanced for first order carryover effects. 
Carryover balance is achieved with very few subjects.
In the experimental design the treatments are numbered 1,...,<code class="reqn">trt</code>. The entry 
<code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> of the design corresponds 
to the treatment the <code class="reqn">i</code>-th subject gets in the <code class="reqn">j</code>-th period.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix representing the experimental design.
