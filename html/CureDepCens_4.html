<h2>Dogs_MimicData data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated data frame with 800 dogs. Simulated dataset that mimic a free-ranging dogs result study. In this simulated dataset it is hypothetically suggested the following causes of outcome: event of interest: death due to natural causes; dependent censoring: age until adopted or death due to human causes; administrative censoring: all other outcomes. More details about the dog study can be found at Paul et al. (2016).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 800 rows and 13 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> u: auxiliary variable, with Uniform distribution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> v: auxiliary variable, with Uniform distribution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> t: variable that represents the failure time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> c: variable that represents the dependent censoring time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> time: time observed until the occurrence of the outcome, min(t,c).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> event: variable that indicates the occurrence of the event of interest, event=1 if the event of interest occurs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> int: auxiliary variable to generate the intercept.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x1_cure: covariate 1, generated from a Binomial distribution. Can denote, for example, a binary result.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x2_cure: covariate 2, generated from a Normal distribution. Can denote, for example, a exam result or an standardized age.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x_c1: covariate 3, generated from a Normal distribution. Can denote, for example, an standardized age.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x_c2: covariate 4, generated from a Binomial distribution. can denote, for example,  an treatment result.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cens: variable that indicates the outcome, cens=1 if the event of interest occurred (death due to natural causes); cens=2 if the  dependent censoring occurred (age until adopted or death due to human causes); cens=3 if administrative censoring.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ident: Variable that indicates the litter or cluster.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
