<h2>Returns which dimensions the individual, locus, and
alleles are in in the genotype object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an internal function that returns the 
locations of genotype dimensions from the genotype
object. It is a relic from when DOQTL put loci in the
second dimension and alleles in the third, while R/qtl2
put loci in the third dimension and alleles in the second.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_geno_dim()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector of three named elements identifying
which dimension the individual (mouse), allele, and loci are in.
