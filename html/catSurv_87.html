<h2>Need For Cognition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data of survey respondents' responses to 18 NFC questions, which is a reduced version of NFC (Cacioppo and Petty 1984). For each question, respondents could choose one of five response options: 1 = agree strongly, 2 = agree somewhat, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = disagree somewhat, 5 = disagree strongly. Missingness is optional.
Observations come from one of three administrations of the survey: The American Panel Survey, Amazon's Mechanical Turk  in fall of 2014, or Amazon's Mechanical Turk in spring of 2015.
