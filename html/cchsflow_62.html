<h2>Number of chronic conditions (6 chronic conditions)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a derived variable (number_conditions)
that counts the number of chronic conditions a respondent has. This function
takes 6 CCHS-defined conditions (heart disease, cancer, stroke, bowel
disorder, mood disorder and arthritis), and well one derived variable
(respiratory condition) to count the number of conditions a respondent has.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">multiple_conditions_fun2(
  CCC_121,
  CCC_131,
  CCC_151,
  CCC_171,
  CCC_280,
  resp_condition_der,
  CCC_051
)
</code></pre>

respiratory condition. (1 = respondent is over the age of 35 and has
a respiratory condition, 2 = respondent is under the age of 35 and has a
respiratory conditions, 3 = respondent does not have a respiratory
condition). See <code>resp_condition_fun1</code> for
documentation on how variable was derived.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>mood disorder (CCC_280) was not asked to respondents in the 2001
CCHS survey cycle. This mean respondents in this cycle will only be able to
have a maximum of 6 chronic conditions as opposed to 7 for respondents in
other cycles. <code>multiple_conditions_fun1</code> is used for CCHS cycles
from 2003 to 2014.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A categorical variable indicating the number of chronic conditions
a respondent has. Respondents with 5 or more conditions are grouped in the
"5+" category.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> # Using rec_with_table() to generate multiple_conditions in a CCHS
 # cycle.
 
 # multiple_conditions_fun2() is specified in variable_details.csv along with
 # the CCHS variables and cycles included.
 
 # To generate multiple_conditions, use rec_with_table() and specify the
 # multiple_conditions, along with the variables that are derived from it.
 # Since resp_condition_der is also a derived variable, you will have to
 # specify the variables that are derived from it. In this example, data
 # from the 2010 CCHS will be used, so DHHGAGE_cont, CCC_091, and CCC_031
 # will be specified along with resp_condition_der.
