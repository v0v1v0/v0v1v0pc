<h2>Covariate-based Covariance Functions for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides routines and methods for estimating and predicting nonstationary Gaussian process models with modular covariate-based covariance functions. Several sources of nonstationarity can be modeled based on spatial information, including a trend, marginal standard deviation, local geometric anisotropy, local nugget, and spatially varying smoothness. Each of these components is modeled separately. A sparse-induced version of the nonstationary covariance function is provided for large datasets to speed up computations. Models are estimated via maximum likelihood (and flavours of it such as penalized and profile maximum likelihood). A variety of functions are also included to compute prediction metrics and to visualize, simulate, and summarize these types of models. Details of the models can be found in the vignette.
