<h2>The CRE package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In health and social sciences, it is critically important to
identify subgroups of the study population where a treatment
has notable heterogeneity in the causal effects with respect
to the average treatment effect. Data-driven discovery of
heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) via decision tree methods
has been proposed for this task. Despite its high interpretability,
the single-tree discovery of HTE tends to be highly unstable and to
find an oversimplified representation of treatment heterogeneity.
To accommodate these shortcomings, we propose Causal Rule Ensemble
(CRE), a new method to discover heterogeneous subgroups through an
ensemble-of-trees approach. CRE has the following features:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p> provides an interpretable representation of the HTE; 2) allows
extensive exploration of complex heterogeneity patterns; and 3)
guarantees high stability in the discovery. The discovered subgroups
are defined in terms of interpretable decision rules, and we develop
a general two-stage approach for subgroup-specific conditional
causal effects estimation, providing theoretical guarantees.
