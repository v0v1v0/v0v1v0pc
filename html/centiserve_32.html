<h2>Find the radiality centrality in a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The radiality is a node centrality index and will give high centralities to vertices that are a short distance to every other vertex in its reachable neighborhood compared to its diameter. <br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">radiality(graph, vids = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
  weights = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph as igraph object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vids</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vertex sequence, the vertices for which the centrality values are returned. Default is all vertices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character constant, gives whether the shortest paths to or from the given vertices should be calculated for directed graphs. If out then the shortest paths from the vertex, if in then to it will be considered. If all, the default, then the corresponding undirected graph will be used, ie. not directed paths are searched. This argument is ignored for undirected graphs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is NULL, the default, and the graph has a weight edge attribute, then the attribute is used. If this is NA then no weights are used (even if the graph has a weight attribute).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Radiality centrality defined as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">C_{rad}(v)=\frac{\sum_{w\in V}(d+1-d(v,w))}{n-1}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">d</code> is diameter of graph G with <code class="reqn">n</code> vertices and <code class="reqn">d(v,w)</code> is distance between vertex <code class="reqn">v</code> and <code class="reqn">w</code>. <br>
The radiality of a node <code class="reqn">v</code> is calculated by computing the shortest path between the node <code class="reqn">v</code> and all other nodes in the graph. The value of each path is then subtracted by the value of the diameter +1 (G+1) and the resulting values are summated. Finally, the obtained value is divided for the number of nodes -1 (n-1). The radiality should be always compared to the closeness and to the eccentricity: a node with high eccentricity + high closeness+ high radiality is a consistent indication of a high central position in the graph. <br>
