<h2>List, download or convert to chillR format data from the CIMIS database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function can do three things related to the California Irrigation
Management Information System ("CIMIS") database: 1. it can list stations
that are close to a specified position (geographic coordinates) 2. it can
retrieve weather data for a named weather station 3. it can 'clean'
downloaded data, so that they can easily be used in chillR Which of these
functions is carried out depends on the action argument.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">handle_cimis(
  action,
  location = NA,
  time_interval = NA,
  station_list = NULL,
  stations_to_choose_from = 25,
  drop_most = TRUE,
  end_at_present = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>action</code></td>
<td>
<p>if this is the character string "list_stations", the function
will return a list of the weather stations from the database that are
closest to the geographic coordinates specified by location.  if this is the
character string "download_weather", the function will attempt to download
weather data from the database for the station named by the location
argument, which should then be a character string corresponding to the
chillRcode of the station (which you can get by running this function in
'list_stations mode) if this is a downloaded weather file (downloaded by
running this function in 'download weather' mode), the function cleans the
file and makes it ready for use in chillR. If the input is just a dataframe
(not a list, as produced with this function), you have to specify the
database name with the database argument</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>location</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a vector of geographic coordinates (for the
'list_stations' mode), or the 'chillRcode' of a weather station in the
specified database (for the 'download_weather' mode. When running this
function for data cleaning only, this is not needed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector with two elements, specifying the start
and end date of the period of interest. Only required when running in
'list_stations' or 'download weather' mode</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>station_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>if the list of weather stations has already been
downloaded, the list can be passed to the function through this argument.
This can save a bit of time, since it can take a bit of time to download the
list, which can have several MB.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stations_to_choose_from</code></td>
<td>
<p>if the location is specified by geographic
coordinates, this argument determines the number of nearby stations in the
list that is returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop_most</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating if most columns should be
dropped from the file. If set to TRUE (default), only essential columns for
running chillR functions are retained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end_at_present</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating whether the interval of
interest should end on the present day, rather than extending until the end
of the year specified under time_interval[2] (if time_interval[2] is the
current year).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can run independently, but it is also called by the
get_weather and weather2chillR functions, which some users might find a bit
easier to handle.
</p>
<p>The CIMIS dataset is described here: http://www.cimis.water.ca.gov/
</p>
<p>Under the 'list_stations' mode, several formats are possible for specifying
the location vector, which can consist of either two or three coordinates
(it can include elevation). Possible formats include c(1,2,3), c(1,2),
c(x=1,y=2,z=3), c(lat=2,long=1,elev=3). If elements of the vector are not
names, they are interpreted as c(Longitude, Latitude, Elevation).
</p>
<p>The 'chillRCode' is generated by this function, when it is run with
geographic coordinates as location inputs. In the list of nearby stations
that is returned then, the chillRCode is provided and can then be used as
input for running the function in 'downloading' mode. For downloading the
data, use the same call as before but replace the location argument with the
chillRCode.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output depends on the action argument. If it is 'list_stations',
the function returns a list of station_to_choose_from weather stations that
are close to the specified location. This list also contains information
about how far away these stations are (in km), how much the elevation
difference is (if elevation is specified; in m) and how much overlap there
is between the data contained in the database and the time period specified
by time_interval. If action is 'download_weather' the output is a list of
two elements: 1. database="CIMIS" 2. the downloaded weather record, extended
to the full duration of the specified time interval. If action is a weather
data.frame or a weather record downloaded with this function (in
'download_weather' mode), the output is the same data in a format that is
easy to use in chillR. If drop_most was set to TRUE, most columns are
dropped.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Many databases have data quality flags, which may sometimes indicate
that data aren't reliable. These are not considered by this function!
</p>
<p>Past CIMIS data is provided to the public as compressed data files of annual
data, which contain data for all stations for the respective years. The same
strategy was followed for monthly data of the past year. This means that in
order to get to the records for one given station, it is necessary to
download data for all stations first, before extracting weather for the
station of interest. This means that downloads take a lot longer than one
might expect, and the downloaded data volume is a multiple of what is really
of interest.
