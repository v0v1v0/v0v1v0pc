<h2>Read data from a reflections file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read data from a *_h.dat-type file containing cell size, spacegroup
symbol and amplitudes and/or phases of observed and/or calculated
structure factors. This function loads the file data into a standardised
named list for structure factors data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_h(filename)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string. Existing file that includes structure 
factors information. The file name in general has the form 
"[prefix]_h.dat".</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list with the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>a    Real numeric. Unit cell length in angstroms. Always 
included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SG.   Spacegroup 2-letters character string. There are only two 
symmetries possible when working within 1D 
crystallography, P1 (no symmetry) and P-1 (inversion 
through the origin). SG can be either "P1" or "P-1". 
Always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hidx. Real numeric array. 1D unique (positive in the 1D context) 
Miller indices. Always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fobs.      Real numeric array. Amplitudes of observed structure 
factors. Not always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sigFobs.   Real numeric array. Errors associated with Fobs. Not 
always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fp.        Real numeric vector. Amplitudes of the positive 
component of Friedel (or Bijvoet) pairs (F+). Not
always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sigFp.     Real numeric vector. Errors associated with Fp. 
Not always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fm.        Real numeric vector. Amplitudes of the negative 
component of Friedel (or Bijvoet) pairs (F-). Not always
included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sigFm.     Real numeric vector. Errors associated with Fm. Not
always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phiobs.    Real numeric array. Phases (in degrees) of structure 
factors obtained with one of the methods used for 
structure solution. Not always included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phicalc.   Real numeric array. Phases (in degrees) of structure 
factors calculated from the correct 1D structure. 
They are normally used to check correctness of 
Phiobs. Not always included.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
