<h2>Map Factors Based on Pareto Arguments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Maps a factor to another factor in a one to many relationship following Pareto principle. For example, 80 percent of transactions can be mapped to 20 percent of customers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">buildPareto(factor1, factor2, pareto)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor1</code></td>
<td>
<p>A factor. This factor is mapped to factor2 as given in the details section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor2</code></td>
<td>
<p>A factor. This factor is mapped to factor1 as given in the details section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pareto</code></td>
<td>
<p>This defines the percentage allocation and is a numeric data type. This argument takes the form of c(x,y) where x and y are numeric and their sum is 100. If we set Pareto to c(80,20), it then allocates 80 percent of factor1 to 20 percent of factor 2. This is based on a well-known concept of the Pareto principle.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used to map one factor to another based on the Pareto argument supplied. If factor1 is a factor of customer identifiers, factor2 is a factor of transactions and Pareto is set to c(80,20), then 80 percent of customer identifiers will be mapped to 20 percent of transactions and vice versa.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with factor 1 and factor 2 as columns. Based on the Pareto arguments passed, column factor 1 is mapped to factor 2.
