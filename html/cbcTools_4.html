<h2>Counts of attribute overlap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function prints out a summary of the amount of "overlap" across
attributes within the choice questions. For example, for each attribute, the
count under <code>"1"</code> is the number of choice questions in which the same level
was shown across all alternatives for that attribute (because there was only
one level shown). Likewise, the count under <code>"2"</code> is the number of choice
questions in which only two unique levels of that attribute were shown, and
so on.

<h3>Value</h3>

the unique number of levels for each attribute.
