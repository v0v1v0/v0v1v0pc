<h2>Empathizing Quotient Cat Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with responses to the 40-item Empathy Quotient personality inventory
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(empathy_cat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>Cat</code> of length 1.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cat object containing item parameters for graded response model fit with
13976 response profiles collected by myPersonality Project, 3050 response profiles
collected by Qualtrics in June 2018, and 1500 response profiles collected by YouGov in June 2018. 
The sample from myPersonality Project was a convenience sample, and the
respondents from YouGov were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education.
</p>
<p>See <code>Cat-class</code> for details regarding the Cat object structure.
See <code>grmCat</code> for details regarding the graded response model.
</p>
<p>A normal prior was chosen with mean from the theta estimates from the YouGov sample (-0.363) and a standard deviation (1.5)
wide enough to envelope the range of estimated theta values across both samples.
</p>
<p>Note that due to how the item parameters were estimated, large, positive values indicate "more" of the latent trait.
</p>
<p>Response options are 1=Strongly disagree; 2=Slightly disagree; 3=Slightly agree; 4=Strongly agree
