<h2>Make hourly temperature record from daily data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates hourly temperature records for a particular location
from daily minimum and maximum temperatures and latitude.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">make_hourly_temps(latitude, year_file, keep_sunrise_sunset = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>latitude</code></td>
<td>
<p>the geographic latitude (in decimal degrees) of the location
of interest</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>year_file</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing data on daily minimum temperature
(called Tmin), daily maximum temperature (called Tmax), and date
information. Dates can either be specified by two columns called Year and
JDay, which contain the Year and Julian date (day of the year), or as three
columns called Year, Month and Day. year_file cannot have any missing
values, so it may be a good idea to process the relevant columns with
make_all_day_table and interpolate_gaps before.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_sunrise_sunset</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating whether information
on sunrise, sunset and daylength, which is calculated for producing hourly
temperature records, should be preserved in the output. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Temperature estimates are based on an idealized daily temperature curve that
uses a sine curve for daytime warming and a logarithmic decay function for
nighttime cooling. The input data frame can have more columns, which are
preserved, but ignored in the processing. References to papers outlining the
procedures are given below.
</p>
<p>Note that this function should be able to generate hourly temperatures for
all latitudes, but it uses an algorithm designed for locations with regular
day/night behavior. It may therefore be that the curves aren't very realistic
for very short or very long days, or especially for polar days and nights.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data frame containing all the columns of year_file, plus 24 columns
for hourly temperatures (called Hour_1 ... Hour_24).
