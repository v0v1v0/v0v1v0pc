<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the 2007-2014 CCHS survey cycles, occupation group has 5
categories. This variable, however, includes a sixth category to account for
the "other" category asked in the 2001 CCHS survey cycle. The categories are
as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Management, Health, Education, Art, Culture
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Business, Finance, Admin
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Sales or Service
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Trades, Transport or Equipment Operator
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Unique to Primary Industry/Processing/Manufacturing
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Other
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this variable, categories from the 2001 CCHS survey cycle were collapsed
to harmonize with the other survey cycles. "Management, Professional
(including accountants), Technologist, Technician or Tech Occupation" were
combined into one category "Management, Health, Education, Art, Culture".
"Farming, Forestry, Fishing, Mining" and "Processing, Manufacturing,
Utilities", were combined into one category "Farming, Forestry, Fishing,
Mining, Processing, Manufacturing, Utilities".
