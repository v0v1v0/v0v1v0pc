<h2>
cta: Contingency Table Analysis Based on ML Fitting of MPH Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contingency table analysis is performed based on maximum likelihood (ML) fitting of multinomial-Poisson homogeneous (MPH) models (Lang, 2004) and homogeneous linear predictor (HLP) models (Lang, 2005). Objects computed include model goodness-of-fit statistics; likelihood-based (cell- and link-specific) residuals; and cell probability and expected count estimates along with standard errors. This package can also compute test-inversion–e.g. Wald, profile likelihood, score, power-divergence–confidence intervals for contingency table estimands, when table probabilities are potentially subject to equality constraints. See Lang (2008) and Zhu (2020) for test-inversion intervals.
