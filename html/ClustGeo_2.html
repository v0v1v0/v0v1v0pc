<h2>estuary data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data refering to n=303 French municipalities  of gironde estuary (a south-ouest French county).
The data are issued from the French population census conducted by the National Institute 
of Statistics and Economic Studies. The dataset is an extraction of four quantitative 
socio-economic variables for a subsample of 303 French municipalities located on the
atlantic coast between Royan and Mimizan. <code>employ.rate.city</code> is the employment rate 
of the municipality, that is the ratio of the number of individuals who have a job to 
the population of working age (generally defined, for the purposes of international 
comparison, as persons of between 15 and 64 years of age). <code>graduate.rate</code> refers 
to the level of education of the population that is the highest degree declared by the 
individual. It is defined here as the ratio for the whole population having completed 
a diploma equivalent or of upper level to two years of higher education 
(DUT, BTS, DEUG, nursing and social training courses, license, maitrise, master, DEA, DESS, doctorate, or Grande Ecole diploma). 
<code>housing.appart</code> is the ratio of apartment housing. <code>agri.land</code> is the part of 
agricultural area of the municipality.
