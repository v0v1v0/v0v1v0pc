<h2>Copy a variable</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Makes a copy of a Crunch variable on the server.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">copyVariable(x, deep = FALSE, ...)

copy(x, deep = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a CrunchVariable to copy</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deep</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should this be a deep copy, in which there is no
dependence on the original variable, or a shallow one, in which the copy
is more of a symbolic link? Default is <code>FALSE</code>, meaning symlink.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional metadata to give to the new variable. If not given,
the new variable will have a name that is the same as the original but with
" (copy)" appended, and its alias will be the old alias with "_copy"
appended.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Copies can be shallow (linked) or deep. Shallow copying is faster and is preferable
unless a true hard copy is required. Shallow copies are effectively pointers to the
original variable, and then you append data to the original
variable or otherwise alter its values, the values in the copy automatically
update. This linking may be desirable, but it comes with some limitations.
First, you cannot edit the values of the copy independently of the original.
Second, some attributes of the copy are immutable: of note, properties of
categories cannot be altered independently in the copy, but you can alter Subvariable names and
ordering within arrays.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a VariableDefinition for the copied variable. Assign into a Dataset
to make the copy happen.
