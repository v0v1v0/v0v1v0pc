<h2>San Francisco COVID-19 Vaccines Given to San Franciscans by Geography</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset represents the COVID-19 vaccinations given to SF residents summarized
by the geographic region of their residential address. All vaccines given to SF residents are
included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered
in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). Data provides counts for people who have received
at least one dose and people who have completed a vaccine series. A vaccine series is complete
after an individual has received both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine.
