Combine Partial Covariance / Relationship Matrices
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Combine partial covariance matrices using a Wishart-EM algorithm. 
    Methods are described in the November 2019 article by Akdemir et al. 
    &lt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857425v1&gt;.
    It can be used to combine partially overlapping covariance matrices 
    from independent trials, partially overlapping multi-view relationship
    data from genomic experiments, partially overlapping Gaussian graphs
    described by their covariance structures. 
    High dimensional covariance estimation, 
    multi-view data integration.
    high dimensional covariance graph estimation.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The input to the main program CovComb is a list of partial covariance matrices. The output is an estimated combined (high dimensional) covariance matrix. The output of the algorithm, the completed covariance matrix, can be used to make inferences about unobserved covariances, as an input to sparse covariance estimation algorithms, in covariance graph estimation, in discriminant analysis.
