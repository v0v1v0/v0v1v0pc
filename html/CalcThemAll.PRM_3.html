<h2>Burr Type III (Inverse Burr) Equation Formula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Burr Type III (Inverse Burr) Equation Formula
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Burr_Type_III_Formula(concentration, scale, shape_location, shape_location_2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>concentration</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of concentration values for a selected pesticide,
that has a Burr Type III shaped species sensitivity distribution,
to run the equation on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Burr Type III scale/b value for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" data frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shape_location</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Burr Type III c/shape value for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them
with their respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shape_location_2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Burr Type III k/shape value for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "pesticide_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them
with their respective distribution variables to the "pesticide_info" table.</p>
