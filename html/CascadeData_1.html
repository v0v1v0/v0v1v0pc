<h2>Experimental Data of Cascade Experiments in Genomics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are the data from the agressive subject group the from GSE39411
dataset, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39411">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39411</a>,

</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>5 leukemic CLL B-lymphocyte of aggressive form were stimulated in vitro with
an anti-IgM antibody, activating the B-cell receptor (BCR). We analyzed the
gene expression at 4 time points (60, 90, 210 and 390 minutes). Each gene
expression measurement is performed both in stimulated cells and in control
unstimulated cells.
</p>
<p>The data were normalized and are ready to use.
</p>
<p>These Experimental Data are used as examples by packages such as the Cascade
one <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt705">doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt705</a> in one of its vignettes. The Cascade
package is a modeling tool allowing gene selection, reverse engineering, and
prediction in Cascade networks.
</p>
<p>Data were collected on HG-U133_Plus_2, Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
Array.
