Overview for data sets of the <code>chipPCR</code> package
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>chipPCR</code> package contains numerous data sets from commercial and 
experimental technologies for the amplification of nucleic acids. The data 
sets include results from qPCR experiments with the 'VideoScan' 'HCU' 
(Roediger et al. 2013), Bio-Rad (iQ5, CFX96), capillary convective PCR (ccPCR) and 
Roche Light Cycler 1.5. Real-time monitored amplification reactions were 
performed using standard amplification methods (qPCR, based on Taq 
polymerase) and quantitative isothermal amplification (qIA). In selected 
data 
sets are melting curves and dilution series available. Most of the data 
sets have equidistant measure points. However, some datasets have none 
homogeneous measure points as indicated below.
