<h2>COVID-19 Cases by Population Characteristics Over Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>TThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 cases by population characteristics
and by specimen collection date. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected.
Population characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or
gender. The City tracks how cases have been distributed among different subgroups.
This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups. Data is lagged by
five days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is 5 days prior to today.
Tests take time to process and report, so more recent data is less reliable.  More details available <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Population-Characteristics-Over-/j7i3-u9ke">here</a>
