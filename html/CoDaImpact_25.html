<h2>Compute share ratio elasticities for CoDa models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In CoDa models with compositional dependent variable (Y) share ratio elasticities (SRE)
allow to interpret the influence of compositional explanatory variables (X).
The interpretation is analogous to usual elasticities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> When the share ratio of X increases by 1% the share ratio of Y increases by SRE%
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The main difference to usual elasticities that, since X is compositional
the change of X musts be specified in terms of a direction in the simplex.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ShareRatioElasticities(object, Xvar, Xdir = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class "lmCoDa"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character indicating the name of the explanatory variable that changes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xdir</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector, a single character, or <code>NULL</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> if numeric <code>Xdir</code> is taken as a fixed direction in the simplex
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> if character <code>Xdir</code> is interpreted as one summit of the X composition and converted to the fixed direction towards this summit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> if <code>NULL</code> the share ratio elasticities are computed for variable directions corresponding the example in Dargel and Thomas-Agnan (2024 Lukas Dargel &amp; Christine Thomas-Agnan (2024) The link between multiplicative competitive interaction models and compositional data regression with a total, Journal of Applied Statistics, DOI: 10.1080/02664763.2024.2329923 )

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
### XY-compositional model
res &lt;- lmCoDa(
  ilr(cbind(left, right, extreme_right)) ~
  ilr(cbind(Educ_BeforeHighschool, Educ_Highschool, Educ_Higher)),
  data =  head(election, 20))

## Focus on changes in the education composition
educ_comp &lt;- "cbind(Educ_BeforeHighschool, Educ_Highschool, Educ_Higher)"

## case 1
## changes towards the summit "Educ_Higher" as (fixed) direction
SRE1 &lt;- ShareRatioElasticities(res, Xvar = educ_comp, Xdir = "Educ_Higher")

SRE1[1,]
# Result: SRE=Inf
# cannot be interpreted because, for this direction,
# the relative change in the share ratio of X (Highschool / BeforeHighschool) is zero
SRE1[7,]
# Result: SRE=0.9
# when the ratio of X (Higher / BeforeHighschool) increases by 1%
# the ratio of Y (right / left) increases by about 0.9%

## case 2
## numeric vector as (fixed) direction
SRE2 &lt;- ShareRatioElasticities(res, Xvar = educ_comp, Xdir = exp(c(0,0,1)))
identical(SRE1,SRE2) # exp(c(0,0,1)) is the direction that points to the third summit

## case 3
## variable directions with Xdir = NULL
## In this case the direction depends components used for the share ratio of X
## In particular the component of X in the numerator grows
## by the same rate as the denominator decreases
SRE3 &lt;- ShareRatioElasticities(res, Xvar = educ_comp, Xdir = NULL)
SRE3[1,]
# Result: SRE=-2.8
# when the ratio of X (Highschool / BeforeHighschool) increases by 1%
# the ratio of Y (right / left) decreases by about -2.8%
