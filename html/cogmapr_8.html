<h2>Concepts indicators of a Social Cognitive Map</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the indicators of concepts of a Social Cognitive Map
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ConceptIndicators(project, filters = NULL, units = "all", weighted.icm = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project</code></td>
<td>
<p>A QDA project, a list as generated by the ProjectCMap function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filters</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of named strings that will filter the relationships showed in the SCM. e.g. =list(coding_class = "A_coding_class", document_part = "A_document_part")=. To date, these filters are linked to the nature of relationships.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string vector giving the names of the units (i.e. classes linked to documents) that will be include in the SCM. It is a second type of filter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weighted.icm</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean. If FALSE, the weight of the relationships in the ICM will be fixed to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Compute the indicators of concepts of a Social Cognitive Map (centrality, indegree, outdegree). It build a user friendly data frame. It includes the 'receiver' and the transmitter character of each vetex. The receiver character of a concept is calculated as the part of the indegree of this concept on its centrality. The transmitter character of a concept is calculated as the part of the outdegree of this concept on its centrality.
</p>
<p>(add formulae)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with the value of some indicators linked to vertices of a map.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">project_name &lt;- "a_new_project"
main_path &lt;- paste0(system.file("testdata", package = "cogmapr"), '/')
my.project &lt;- ProjectCMap(main_path, project_name)

ConceptIndicators(my.project)
</code></pre>
