<h2>Copy and rename images based on camera trap station ID and creation date</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function renames and copies raw camera trap images into a new location
where they can be identified. Images are renamed with camera trap station
ID, camera ID (optional), creation date and a numeric identifier for images
taken within one minute of each other at a given station. Station ID and
camera ID are derived from the raw image directory structure. The creation
date is extracted from image metadata using ExifTool.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">imageRename(
  inDir,
  outDir,
  hasCameraFolders,
  keepCameraSubfolders,
  createEmptyDirectories = FALSE,
  copyImages = FALSE,
  writecsv = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inDir</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. Directory containing camera trap images sorted into
station subdirectories (e.g. inDir/StationA/)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outDir</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. Directory into which the renamed images will be
copied</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hasCameraFolders</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Do the station directories in <code>inDir</code>
have camera subdirectories (e.g. "inDir/StationA/Camera1")?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keepCameraSubfolders</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should camera directories be preserved
as subdirectories of <code>outDir</code> (e.g. "outDir/StationA/CameraA1")?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>createEmptyDirectories</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If station or camera directories are
empty, should they be copied nevertheless (causing empty directories in
<code>outDir</code>, but preserving the whole directory structure)?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>copyImages</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Copy images to <code>outDir</code>?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>writecsv</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Save a data frame with a summary as a .csv? The csv
will be saved in <code>outDir</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Setting up the correct raw image directory structure is necessary for
running the function successfully. <code>inDir</code> is the main directory that
contains camera trap station subdirectories (e.g. inDir/StationA). If one
camera was deployed per station and no camera subdirectories are used within
station directories, <code>hasCameraFolders</code> can be set to <code>FALSE</code>. If
more than one camera was deployed at stations, there must be subdirectories
for the individual camera traps within the station directories (e.g.
"inDir/StationA/CameraA1" and "inDir/StationA/CameraA2"). Even if only some
stations had multiple cameras, all station will need camera subdirectories.
The argument <code>hasCameraFolders</code> must be <code>TRUE</code>. Within the camera
subdirectories, the directory structure is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>Renaming of images follows the following pattern: If <code>hasCameraFolders</code>
is TRUE, it is: "StationID__CameraID__Date__Time(Number).JPG", e.g.
"StationA__CameraA1__2015-01-31__18-59-59(1).JPG". If
<code>hasCameraFolders</code> is FALSE, it is:
"StationID__Date__Time(Number).JPG", e.g.
"StationA__2015-01-31__18-59-59(1).JPG".
</p>
<p>The purpose of the number in parentheses is to prevent assigning identical
file names to images taken at the same station (and camera) in the same
second, as can happen if cameras take sequences of images. It is a
consecutive number given to all images taken at the same station by the same
camera within one minute. The double underscore "__" in the image file names
is for splitting and extracting information from file names in other
functions (e.g. for retrieving camera IDs in <code>recordTable</code> if
camera subdirectories are not preserved (<code>keepCameraSubfolders =
FALSE</code>)).
</p>
<p>The function finds all JPEG images and extracts the image timestamp from the
image metadata using ExifTool and copies the images (with new file names)
into <code>outDir</code>, where it will set up a directory structure based on the
station IDs and, if required by <code>keepCameraSubfolders = TRUE</code>, camera
IDs (e.g. outDir/StationA/ or outDir/StationA/CameraA1).
</p>
<p><code>copyImages</code> can be set to FALSE to simulate the renaming and check the
file names of the renamed images without copying. If you are handling large
number of images (&gt;e.g., 100,000), the function may take some time to run.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with original directory and file names, new
directory and file names and an indicator for whether images were copied
successfully.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">


  ## Not run: 
  
### "trial" run. create a table with file names after renaming, but don't copy images.

# first, find sample image directory in package directory:
wd_images_raw &lt;- system.file("pictures/raw_images", package = "camtrapR")

# because copyImages = FALSE, outDir does not need to be defined
renaming.table &lt;- imageRename(inDir               = wd_images_raw,     
                              hasCameraFolders = FALSE,
                              copyImages          = FALSE,
                              writecsv            = FALSE
  )


  
### a real example in which images are copied and renamed 

  # define raw image location
wd_images_raw &lt;- system.file("pictures/raw_images", package = "camtrapR") 

  # define destination for renamed images
wd_images_raw_renamed &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), "raw_images_renamed")       


  # now we have to define outDir because copyImages = TRUE
renaming.table2 &lt;- imageRename(inDir               = wd_images_raw,
                               outDir              = wd_images_raw_renamed,       
                               hasCameraFolders    = FALSE,
                               copyImages          = TRUE,
                               writecsv            = FALSE
  )
  
  # show output files
  list.files(wd_images_raw_renamed, recursive = TRUE)
  
  # output table
  renaming.table2
  
  
## End(Not run)
