<h2>Colley method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to compute rating and ranking
using Colley method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rate_colley(cr_data)

rank_colley(cr_data, keep_rating = FALSE, ties = c("average", "first",
  "last", "random", "max", "min"), round_digits = 7)
</code></pre>

as_longcr().</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This rating method was initially designed for games between two
players. There will be an error if in <code>cr_data</code> there is a game not between
two players. Convert input competition results manually or with
to_pairgames() from <code>comperes</code> package.
</p>
<p>It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for the
player.
</p>
<p>Computation is done based only on the games between players of interest (see
Players). <strong>Note</strong> that it isn't necessary for all players of interest to be
present in <code>cr_data</code> but it might be a good idea in order to obtain plausible
outcome rating.
</p>
<p>The outline of the Colley method is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Compute Colley matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of games
played by certain player <em>plus 2</em>, off-diagonal are equal to minus number of
common games played. This matrix will be the matrix of system of linear
equations (SLE).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Compute right-hand side of SLE as 1 + 0.5*("number of player's wins" -
"number of player's losses").
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Solve the SLE. The solution is the Colley rating.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>rate_colley()</code> returns a tibble with columns
<code>player</code> (player identifier) and <code>rating_colley</code> (Colley
rating). The mean rating should be 0.5. <strong>Bigger value
indicates better player performance</strong>.
</p>
<p><code>rank_colley()</code> returns a <code>tibble</code> with columns <code>player</code>, <code>rating_colley</code> (if
<code>keep_rating = TRUE</code>) and <code>ranking_colley</code> (Colley ranking
computed with <code>round_rank()</code>).
</p>


<h3>Players</h3>

<p><code>comperank</code> offers a possibility to handle certain set of players. It is done
by having <code>player</code> column (in longcr format) as factor
with levels specifying all players of interest. In case of factor the result
is returned only for players from its levels. Otherwise - for all present
players.
