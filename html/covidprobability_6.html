<h2>The remaining individuals who would not be expected to show symptoms yet</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Every day, a certain number of people are expected to show symptoms, based
on the incubation period. This would typically lead to further investigation
and ongoing suspicion of an outbreak. This function calculates the proportion
of individuals on a given day that would not be expected to have developed
symptoms yet. So if no one has developed symptoms, this proportion of people
could still have undetected COVID-19.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">prop_remaining(t, asympt, mu = 1.63, sigma = 0.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>day</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>asympt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The proportion of positive patients who would be expected not
to ever develop symptoms (true asymptomatic patients).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mu</code></td>
<td>
<p>The mean of a lognormal distribution that approximates the
incubation period for COVID-19. E.g. 1.63 (see reference).</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>The standard deviation of a lognormal distribution that
approximates the incubation period for COVID-19. E.g. 0.5
(see reference).</p>
