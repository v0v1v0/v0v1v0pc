<h2>deleteNearZeroCoefficientOfVariation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters out variables from a dataset that exhibit a coefficient of variation below a
specified threshold, ensuring the retention of variables with meaningful variability.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">deleteNearZeroCoefficientOfVariation(X, LIMIT = 0.1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric matrix or data.frame. Explanatory variables. Qualitative variables must be transform
into binary variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>LIMIT</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Cutoff for minimum variation. If coefficient is lesser than the limit, the
variables are removed because not vary enough (default: 0.1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>deleteNearZeroCoefficientOfVariation</code> function is a pivotal tool in data preprocessing,
especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. The coefficient of variation (CoV) is a
normalized measure of data dispersion, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
In many scientific investigations, variables with a low CoV might be considered as offering
limited discriminative information, potentially leading to noise in subsequent statistical analyses.
By setting a threshold through the <code>LIMIT</code> parameter, this function provides a systematic approach
to identify and exclude variables that do not meet the desired variability criteria. The underlying
rationale is that variables with a CoV below the set threshold might not contribute significantly
to the variability of the dataset and could be redundant or even detrimental for certain analyses.
The function returns a modified dataset, a list of deleted variables, and the computed coefficients
of variation for each variable. This comprehensive output ensures that researchers are well-informed
about the preprocessing steps and can make subsequent analytical decisions with confidence.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Return a list of two objects:
<code>X</code>: The new data.frame X filtered.
<code>variablesDeleted</code>: The variables that have been removed by the filter.
<code>coeff_variation</code>: The coefficient variables per each variable tested.
