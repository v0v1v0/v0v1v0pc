<h2>Concentration of minor elements in carbon ashes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The montana data set consists of 229 samples of the concentration (in ppm) of
minor elements [Cr, Cu, Hg, U, V] in carbon ashes from the Fort Union
formation (Montana, USA), side of the Powder River Basin. The formation is
mostly Palaeocene in age, and the coal is the result of deposition in
conditions ranging from fluvial to lacustrine. All samples were taken from
the same seam at different sites over an area of 430 km by 300 km, which
implies that on average, the sampling spacing is 24 km. Using the spatial
coordinates of the data, a semivariogram analysis was conducted for each
chemical element in order to check for a potential spatial dependence
structure in the data (not shown here). No spatial dependence patterns
were observed for any component, which allowed us to assume an independence
of the chemical samples at different locations.
</p>
<p>The aforementioned chemical components actually represent a fully observed
subcomposition of a much larger chemical composition. The five elements are
not closed to a constant sum. Note that, as the samples are expressed in
parts per million and all concentrations were originally measured, a residual
element could be defined to fill up the gap to 10^6.
