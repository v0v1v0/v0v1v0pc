<h2>Complete a matrix of rankings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fills an incomplete matrix of rankings with means of
unallocated ranks</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> muranks(x,allranks=NULL,rankx=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector or matrix of rankings that may contain ties and NAs.
Objects ranked are assumed to be columns and ranking methods rows.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allranks</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional list of all ranks that might have been
allocated. Defaults to the unique values in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rankx</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to apply the ‘<span class="samp">⁠rank⁠</span>’ function (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠muranks⁠</span>’ assumes that the values in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ are rankings with
values in the set ‘<span class="samp">⁠allranks⁠</span>’ or if that is NULL, between 1 and the
number of columns or values in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’. If any values in ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ are
outside this range, or if the missing ranks are not sequential, the
function will drop that row with a warning.
</p>
<p>For each row, the function finds the mean of those ranks in ‘<span class="samp">⁠allranks⁠</span>’
that were not allocated and substitutes that value for any missing values
in the row.
</p>
<p>If ‘<span class="samp">⁠rankx⁠</span>’ is TRUE, each row is passed to ‘<span class="samp">⁠rank⁠</span>’. This will
convert competition ranks or any set of numbers to the usual mean rankings.
This will also override the rejection of rows in which the missing ranks
are not sequential, and may produce counterintuitive imputed ranks.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix similar to ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ in which any NAs are replaced by the mean of
unallocated ranks for each row.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>‘<span class="samp">⁠muranks⁠</span>’ will impute ranks for "best/worst" ranking, where the 
method (rater) allocates the highest ranks to the most preferred data 
objects and the lowest ranks to the least preferred. The mean of all 
unallocated ranks is imputed for unranked data objects. It is assumed that 
unranked data objects are considered less preferred than those allocated 
high ranks, more preferred than those allocated low ranks, and not 
differentiated from each other. If this assumption is not satisfied, 
‘<span class="samp">⁠muranks⁠</span>’ will warn the operator that one or more rows have been 
dropped. To explain this behavior, consider the case in which a method 
allocates the ranks 1,2,3,5,7,8 to eight data objects. Two ranks have not 
been allocated, 4 and 6. It would be possible to impute the mean, 5, to 
both, but this ignores the implicit information that the two data objects 
were differentiated by the rank 5, which is "between" them. Only in the 
unlikely case that both were considered equivalent to the object ranked 5 
would this be correct, as there is no way to establish which was more or 
less preferred. The operator should be aware that if ‘<span class="samp">⁠rankx⁠</span>’ is TRUE, 
the unranked objects will be allocated the lowest ranks, which is unlikely 
to be correct.
