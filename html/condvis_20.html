Tuefekci's powerplant data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power
Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full
load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T),
Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to
predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
</p>
<p>A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam
turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity
is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and
is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from 
and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables
affect the GT performance.
