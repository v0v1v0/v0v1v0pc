<h2>To Include a Non-Parametrically Modelled Predictor in a SHAPESELECT Formula</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A symbolic routine to indicate that a predictor is included as a non-parametrically modeled predictor in a formula argument to ShapeSelect.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">in.or.out(z)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p>A non-parametrically modelled predictor which has the same length as the response vector.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To include a categorical predictor, in.or.out(factor(z)) is used, and to include a linear predictor z, in.or.out(z) is used. If in.or.out is not used, the user can include z in a model by adding z or factor(z) in a ShapeSelect formula.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The vector z with three attributes, i.e., nm: the name of z; shape: 1 or 0 (in or out of the model); type: "fac" or "lin", i.e., z is modelled as a categorical predictor or a linear predictor.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
  n &lt;- 100
  # x is a continuous predictor 
  x &lt;- runif(n)
  
  # generate z and to include it as a categorical predictor
  z &lt;- rep(0:1, 50)

  # y is generated as correlated to both x and z
  # the relationship between y and x is smoothly increasing-convex
  y &lt;- x^2 + 2 * I(z == 1) + rnorm(n, sd = 1)

  # call ShapeSelect to find the best model by the genetic algorithm
  # factor(z) may be in or out of the model  
  fit &lt;- ShapeSelect(y ~ shapes(x) + in.or.out(factor(z)), genetic = TRUE)

  # factor(z) isn't chosen and is included in the model
  fit &lt;- ShapeSelect(y ~ shapes(x) + factor(z), genetic = TRUE)

## End(Not run)
