<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R functions for categorical data analysis
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for analyzing multivariate data.
Dependencies of the distribution of specified variable (response variable) to
other variables (explanatory variables) are derived and evaluated by AIC
(Akaike Information Criterion).
</p>
<p>Functions <code>catdap1</code> and <code>catdap1c</code> are for the
analysis of categorical data. Every variable is specified as the response
variable in turn and the goodness of other variables as the explanatory
variables to the specified variable is evaluated by AIC.
</p>
<p>Function <code>catdap2</code> can be applied to data where categorical
variable and numerical variable are mixed. Specifying one variable as the
response variable, the dependencies of its distribution on sets of other
variables are investigated. If the response variable is categorical,
contingency table analysis method is employed. If the response variable is
numerical, categorizing the response variable by pooling, the problem is
reduced to the categorical response variable case. This method eventually
finds the dependency of the histogram of numerical response variable on sets
of explanatory variables.
</p>
<p>The Fortran source program codes for above functions were published in
Sakamoto, Ishiguro and Kitagawa (1983), and Frontiers of Times Series Modeling
3 : Modeling Seasonality &amp; Periodicity ; ISM (2002), respectively.
