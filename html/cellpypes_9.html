<h2>Call and visualize 'classify' function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Call and visualize 'classify' function
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plot_classes(
  obj,
  classes = NULL,
  knn_refine = 0,
  replace_overlap_with = "Unassigned",
  return_logical_matrix = FALSE,
  fast = NULL,
  point_size = 0.4,
  point_size_legend = 2,
  base_size = 15,
  overdispersion = 0.01
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>A cellpypes object, see section <strong>cellpypes Objects</strong> below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>classes</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector with one or more class names.
If NULL (the default), plots finest available cell types
(all classes that are not parent of any other class).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>knn_refine</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric between 0 and 1. If 0, do not refine labels
obtained from UMI count pooling.
If larger than 0 (recommended: 0.1), cellpypes will try to label
unassigned cells by majority vote, see section <strong>knn_refine</strong> below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replace_overlap_with</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string, by default: <code>"Unassigned"</code>.
See section <strong>Handling overlap</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return_logical_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If TRUE,
a logical matrix with
classes in columns and cells in rows is returned instead of resolving
overlaps with <code>replace_overlap_with</code>.
If a single class is supplied, the matrix has exactly one
column and the user can pipe it into "drop" to convert it to a vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fast</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set this to TRUE if you want fast plotting in spite of many cells
(using the scattermore package). If NULL (default), cellpypes decides
automatically and fast plotting is done for more than 10k cells, if FALSE
it always uses <code>geom_point</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>point_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dot size used by geom_point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>point_size_legend</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dot size displayed in legend.
Legend colors are easier to read with larger points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>base_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>The base_size of theme_bw, i.e.
how large text is displayed. Default: 15.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overdispersion</code></td>
<td>
<p>Defaults to 0.01, only change it if you know
what you are doing.
If set to 0, the NB simplifies to the Poisson distribution, and larger
values give more variance.
The 0.01 default value follows the recommendation by
Lause, Berens and Kobak (Genome Biology 2021) to use
<code>size=100</code> in pnbinom for typical data sets.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggplot2 object.

<h3>cellpypes Objects</h3>

<p>A cellpypes object is a list with four slots:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>raw </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>(sparse) matrix with genes in rows, cells in columns</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>totalUMI </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the colSums of obj$raw</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>embed </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>two-dimensional embedding of the cells, provided as data.frame
or tibble with two columns and one row per cell.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>neighbors </code></dt>
<dd>
<p>index matrix with one row per cell and k columns, where
k is the number of nearest neighbors (we recommend 15&lt;k&lt;100, e.g. k=50).
Here are two ways to get the neighbors index matrix:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Use <code>find_knn(featureMatrix)$idx</code>, where featureMatrix could be
principal components, latent variables or normalized genes (features in
rows, cells in columns).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> use <code>as(seurat@graphs[["RNA_nn"]], "dgCMatrix")&gt; .1</code> to extract
the kNN
graph computed on RNA. The <code>&gt; .1</code> ensures this also works with RNA_snn,
wknn/wsnn or any other
available graph – check with <code>names(seurat@graphs)</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Handling overlap</h3>

<p>Overlap denotes all cells
for which rules from multiple classes apply, and these cells will be
labeled as <code>Unassigned</code> by default.
If you are in fact interested in where the overlap is,
set <code>return_logical_matrix</code>=TRUE and inspect the result.
Note that
it matters whether you call <code>classify("Tcell")</code> or
<code>classify(c("Tcell","Bcell")</code> – any existing overlap between T and B cells
is labelled as <code>Unassigned</code> in
this second call, but not in the first.
</p>
<p>Replacing overlap happens only between mutually
exclusive labels (such as Tcell and Bcell), but
not within a lineage.
To make an example, overlap is NOT replaced between child (PD1+Ttox) and
parent (Ttox) or any other ancestor (Tcell), but instead the
most detailed cell type (PD1+Ttox) is returned.
</p>
<p>All of the above is also true for <code>plot_classes</code>, as it wraps <code>classify</code>.
</p>


<h3>knn_refine</h3>

<p>With <code>knn_refine &gt; 0</code>, cellpypes refines cell type labels with a kNN classifier.
</p>
<p>By default, cellpypes only assigns cells to a class if all relevant rules
apply.
In other words, all marker gene UMI counts in the cell's neighborhood all have to
be clearly above/below their threshold.
Since UMI counts are sparse (even after neighbor pooling done by cellpypes),
this can leave many cells unassigned.
</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume an unassigned cell is of the same cell type as the
majority of its nearest neighbors.
Therefore, cellpypes implements a kNN classifier to further refine labels
obtained by
manually thresholding UMI counts.
<code>knn_refine = 0.3</code> means a cell is assigned the class label held by
most of its neighbors unless no class gets more than 30 %.
If most neighbors are unassigned, the cell will also be set to "Unassigned".
Choosing <code>knn_refine = 0.3</code> gives results reminiscent of clustering
(which assigns all cells),
while <code>knn_refine = 0.5</code> leaves cells 'in between' two similar
cell types unassigned.
</p>
<p>We recommend looking at <code>knn_refine =  0</code> first as it's faster and
more directly tied to marker gene expression.
If assigning all cells is desired, we recommend <code>knn_refine = 0.3</code> or lower,
while <code>knn_refine = 0.5</code> makes cell types more 'crisp' by setting cells
'in between' related subtypes to "Unassigned".
