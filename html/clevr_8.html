<h2>Transform Clustering Representations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transform between different representations of a clustering.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clusters_to_membership(clusters, elem_ids = NULL, clust_ids = NULL)

membership_to_clusters(membership, elem_ids = NULL, clust_ids = NULL)

clusters_to_pairs(clusters)

membership_to_pairs(membership, elem_ids = NULL)

pairs_to_membership(pairs, elem_ids)

pairs_to_clusters(pairs, elem_ids)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clusters</code></td>
<td>
<p>a representation of a clustering as a list of vectors,
where the i-th vector contains the identifiers of elements assigned to the
i-th cluster. If <code>clust_ids</code> is specified (see below), the i-th cluster
is identified according to the corresponding entry in <code>clust_ids</code>.
Otherwise the i-th cluster is identified according it's name (if
<code>clusters</code> is a named list) or its integer index i.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>elem_ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector specifying the complete set of identifiers for the
cluster elements in canonical order. Optional for all functions excluding
<code>pairs_to_membership</code> and <code>pairs_to_clusters</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clust_ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector specifying the complete set of identifiers for
the clusters in canonical order. Optional for all functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>membership</code></td>
<td>
<p>a representation of a clustering as a membership vector,
where the i-th entry contains the cluster identifier for the i-th element.
If <code>elem_ids</code> is specified (see below), the i-th element is identified
according to the corresponding entry in <code>elem_ids</code>. Otherwise the i-th
element is identified according it's name (if <code>members</code> is a named vector)
or its integer index i.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pairs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a representation of a clustering as a matrix or data.frame
containing all pairs of elements that are co-clustered. The rows index
of the matrix/data.frame index pairs and columns index the identifiers
of the constituent elements. The <code>elem_ids</code> argument (see below) must be
specified in order to recover singleton clusters (containing a single
element).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>clusters_to_membership</code> and <code>pairs_to_membership</code> both return a
membership vector representation of the clustering. The order of the
elements is taken from <code>elem_ids</code> if specified, otherwise the elements are
ordered lexicographically by their identifiers. For
<code>pairs_to_membership</code>, the cluster identifiers cannot be recovered and
are taken to be integers.
</p>
<p><code>membership_to_clusters</code> and <code>pairs_to_clusters</code> both return a
representation of the clustering as a list of vectors. The order of the
clusters is taken from <code>clust_ids</code> if specified, otherwise the clusters
are ordered lexicographically by their identifiers. For
<code>pairs_to_clusters</code>, the cluster identifiers cannot be recovered and
are taken to be integers.
</p>
<p><code>clusters_to_pairs</code> and <code>membership_to_pairs</code> both return a
representation of the clustering as a matrix of element pairs that are
co-clustered. This representation results in loss of information, as
singleton clusters (with one element) and cluster identifiers are not
represented.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## A clustering of three items represented as a membership vector
m &lt;- c("Item1" = 1, "Item2" = 2, "Item3" = 1)

# Transform to list of clusters
membership_to_clusters(m)
# Specify different identifiers for the items
membership_to_clusters(m, elem_ids = c(1, 2, 3))
# Transform to array of pairs that are co-clustered
membership_to_pairs(m)

## A clustering represented as a list of clusters
cl &lt;- list("ClustA" = c(1,3), "ClustB" = c(2))

# Transform to membership vector representation
clusters_to_membership(cl)
# Transform to array of pairs that are co-clustered
clusters_to_pairs(cl)

## A clustering (incompletely) represented as an array of pairs that
## are co-clustered
p &lt;- rbind(c(1,3)) # pairs of elements in the same cluster
ids &lt;- c(1,2,3)    # necessary to specify set of all elements

# Transform to membership vector representation
pairs_to_membership(p, ids)
# Transform to list of clusters
pairs_to_clusters(p, ids)
