<h2>Simulated individual-level binary outcome and baseline variables for study 1 in Dickinson et al (2015)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>At the end of the study, the researchers will have ascertained the outcome in the
16 clusters. Suppose that the researchers were able to assess 300 children in each cluster.
We simulated correlated outcome data at the individual level using a generalized linear
mixed model (GLMM) to induce correlation by including a random effect. The intracluster
correlation (ICC) was set to be 0.01, using the latent response definition provided in
Eldrige et al. (2009). This is a reasonable value of the ICC for population health studies
(Hannan et al. 1994). We simulated one data set, with the outcome data dependent on the
county-level covariates used in the constrained randomization design and a positive treatment
effect so that the practice-based intervention increases up-to-date immunization rates more
than the community-based intervention. For each individual child, the outcome is equal to 1
if he or she is up-to-date on immunizations and 0 otherwise.

<p>Note that we still categorize the continuous variable of average income to illustrate
the use of cvcrand on multi-category variables, and we truncated the percentage
in CIIS variable at 100
