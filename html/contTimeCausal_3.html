<h2>Continuous-time Structural Failure Time Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function estimates the regime (in terms of time to treatment initiation)
of treatment effect for a survival outcome under a 
Structural Failure Time Model (SFTM)
with time-varying confounding in the presence of dependent censoring.
Studying the effect of time to treatment discontinuation is applicable 
by redefining "treatment initiation" in the current description to 
"treatment discontinuation".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ctSFTM(data, base = NULL, td = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame object. A data.frame containing all observed data.
At a minimum, this data.frame must contain columns with headers 
"id", "U", "V", "deltaU", and "deltaV". If time-dependent covariates are
included, additional columns include "stop" and "start". See Details for
further information</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>base</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character or integer vector or NULL. The columns of data to be
included in the time-independent component of the model. If NULL, 
time-independent covariates are excluded from the Cox model for 
treatment discontinuation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>td</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character or integer vector or NULL. The columns of data to be
included in the time-dependent component of the model. If NULL, 
time-dependent covariates are excluded from the Cox model for 
treatment discontinuation.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The SFTM assumes that the potential failure time <code>U</code> had the individual 
never received treatment and the observed failure time <code>T</code> follow
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">U \sim \int_0^T e^{\psi A_u}d u, </code>
</p>

<p>where <code>~</code> means "has the same distribution as", and <code class="reqn">A_u</code> is the 
treatment indicator at time <code class="reqn">u</code>.
We assume that the individual continuously received treatment until 
time <code class="reqn">V</code>. The observed failure time can be censored assuming the 
censoring time is independent of the failure time given the treatment and 
covariate history (the so-called ignorable censoring). The current 
function allows for multi-dimensional baseline covariates and/or
multi-dimensional time-dependent covariate.
Variance estimates should be implemented by delete-one-group jackknifing 
and recalling ctSFTM.
</p>
<p>If only time-independent covariates are included, the data.frame must 
contain the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique participant identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt>U:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time to the clinical event or censoring.</p>
</dd>
<dt>deltaU:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The clinical event indicator (1 if U is the event time;
0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>V:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time to optional treatment discontinuation, a clinical 
event, censoring, or a treatment-terminating event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>deltaV:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator of optional treatment discontinuation 
(1 if treatment discontinuation was optional; 0 if 
treatment discontinuation was due to a clinical event, 
censoring or a treatment-terminating event.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If time-dependent covariates are to be included, the data.frame must be
a time-dependent dataset as described by package survival. Specifically,
the time-dependent data must be specified for an interval (lower,upper]
and the data must include the following additional columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>start:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower boundary of the time interval to which the
data pertain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stop:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper boundary of the time interval to which the
data pertain.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class ctc. Object contains element ‘psi’, the 
estimate of the SFTM parameter(s) and ‘coxPH’, the Cox 
regression for V.
