<h2>Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment
(SUPPORT)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The SUPPORT dataset tracks four response variables: hospital
death, severe functional disability, hospital costs, and time until death
and death itself. The patients are followed for up to 5.56 years. Data
included only tracks follow-up time and death.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">support
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe with 9104 observations and 34 variables after imputation
and the removal of response variables like hospital charges, patient ratio
of costs to charges and micro-costs. Ordinal variables, namely functional
disability and income, were also removed. Finally, Surrogate activities of
daily living were removed due to sparsity. There were 6 other model scores
in the data-set and they were removed; only aps and sps were kept.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some of the original data was missing. Before imputation, there were
a total of 9105 individuals and 47 variables. Of those variables, a few
were removed before imputation. We removed three response variables:
hospital charges, patient ratio of costs to charge,s and patient
micro-costs. Next, we removed hospital death as it was directly informative
of our event of interest, namely death. We also removed functional
disability and income as they are ordinal covariates. Finally, we removed 8
covariates related to the results of previous findings: we removed SUPPORT
day 3 physiology score (<code>sps</code>), APACHE III day 3 physiology score
(<code>aps</code>), SUPPORT model 2-month survival estimate, SUPPORT model
6-month survival estimate, Physician's 2-month survival estimate for pt.,
Physician's 6-month survival estimate for pt., Patient had Do Not
Resuscitate (DNR) order, and Day of DNR order (&lt;0 if before study). Of
these, <code>sps</code> and <code>aps</code> were added on after imputation, as they
were missing only 1 observation. First we imputed manually using the normal
values for physiological measures recommended by Knaus et al. (1995). Next,
we imputed a single dataset using <span class="pkg">mice</span> with default settings. After
imputation, we noted that the covariate for surrogate activities of daily
living was not imputed. This is due to collinearity between the other two
covariates for activities of daily living. Therefore, surrogate activities
of daily living was removed.
