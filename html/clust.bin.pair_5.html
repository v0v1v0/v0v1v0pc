<h2>Psychiatrist and patient disagreement data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Psychiatrists and their patients were surveyed in pairs regarding patient
concerns and treatment. Each psychiatrist was asked whether each question
item was relevant to their patient and each of their patients were asked the
same. The data can be evaluated to answer the question of whether there was
patient/doctor agreement in each item. The sample was 29 psychiatrists, each
with 1-8 patients, for a total of N = 135 matched pairs.
