<h2>Collapse rows and columns of a table on the basis of hierarchical clustering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to collapse the rows and columns of the input
contingency table on the basis of the results of a hierarchical
clustering.<br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">table.collapse(data, graph = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the dataset (must be in dataframe format)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical (TRUE/FALSE); it takes TRUE if the user wants the row
and colum profiles dendrograms to be produced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function returns a list containing the input table, the rows-collapsed
table, the columns-collapsed table, and a table with both rows and columns
collapsed. It optionally returns two dendrograms (one for the row profiles,
one for the column profiles) representing the clusters.<br></p>
<p>The hierarchical clustering is obtained using the FactoMineR's 'HCPC()' function.<br>
Rationale: clustering rows and/or columns of a table could interest the users
who want to know where a "significant association is concentrated" by
"collecting together similar rows (or columns) in discrete groups" (Greenacre
M, Correspondence Analysis in Practice, Boca Raton-London-New York,
Chapman&amp;Hall/CRC 2007, pp. 116, 120). Rows and/or columns are progressively
aggregated in a way in which every successive merging produces the smallest
change in the table's inertia. The underlying logic lies in the fact that
rows (or columns) whose merging produces a small change in table's inertia
have similar profiles. This procedure can be thought of as maximizing the
between-group inertia and minimizing the within-group inertia.<br> 
A method essentially similar is that provided by the 'FactoMineR' package (Husson F,
Le S, Pages J, Exploratory Multivariate Analysis by Example Using R, Boca
Raton-London-New York, CRC Press, pp. 177-185). The cluster solution is based
on the following rationale: a division into Q (i.e., a given number of)
clusters is suggested when the increase in between-group inertia attained
when passing from a Q-1 to a Q partition is greater than that from a Q to a
Q+1 clusters partition. In other words, during the process of rows (or
columns) merging, if the following aggregation raises highly the
within-group inertia, it means that at the further step very different
profiles are being aggregated.
