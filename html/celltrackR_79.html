<h2>Extract Subtracks Starting at a Specific Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Obtain all subtracks of i steps (i+1 positions) starting at a given timepoint t.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">subtracksByTime(X, t, i = 1, epsilon = 1e-04, tlo = t, thi = t)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Tracks object to obtain subtracks from.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>Timepoint at which the subtracks should start. This value is ignored if
tlo and thi are specified, see below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td>
<p>Subtrack length (in number of steps). Set this to NULL to obtain subtracks
of varying length but within a specified interval [tlo, thi] (see below).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>epsilon</code></td>
<td>
<p>Small error allowed when comparing timepoints because of numerical
inaccuracies, see details. Timepoints in tracks are returned if they are within
[tlo-epsilon, thi+epsilon].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tlo, thi</code></td>
<td>
<p>Interval specifying the timepoints to be returned. By default, these
are not used and tracks starting at timepoint t with exactly i steps are returned;
see details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If i is specified, the given t is retrieved for all tracks in X that contain that
timepoint, and any subtracks starting from that time that have exactly i steps are
returned. For numerical reasons, timepoints in the data are allowed to deviate
a small amount epsilon from t (because otherwise, equal timepoints can seem unequal
because of very small deviations).
</p>
<p>If i is set to NULL, subtracks are returned with all timepoints lying in the interval
[ tlo - epsilon, thi + epsilon ]. These subtracks do NOT have to be of equal length.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>tracks</em> object is returned which contains all the subtracks
of any track in the input <em>tracks</em> object that consist of exactly 'i'
segments and start at the given timepoint t, OR a
<em>tracks</em> object with all the timepoints
of any track in the input <em>tracks</em> object that are between tlo and thi.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>subtracks</code> to extract all subtracks of a given length,
<code>prefixes</code> to extract all subtracks of a given length starting
from the first coordinate in each track, <code>selectSteps</code> to extract
single steps starting at a fixed timepoint from a subset of trackids, and
<code>timePoints</code> to return all timepoints occurring in the dataset.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Get all the single steps (i=1) starting at the third timepoint in the T cell tracks.
subT &lt;- subtracksByTime( TCells, timePoints(TCells)[3], 1 )

## These all have the same number of steps:
sapply( subT, nrow )

## Or set i to NULL and return all subtracks within the five first timepoints:
subT2 &lt;- subtracksByTime( TCells, NULL, i = NULL,
  tlo = timePoints( TCells )[1], thi = timePoints( TCells )[5] )

## These are not all the same length:
sapply( subT2, nrow )
