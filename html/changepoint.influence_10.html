<h2>
Welllog data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data has been used in previous changepoint papers and is described and provided in "On-line inference for hidden Markov models via particle filters" by Fearnhead and Clifford in 2003.
The data consists of measurements of the nuclear magnetic response of underground rocks.
</p>
<p>Please note that this is the original data.  The data analyzed in the majority of publications has been standardized and/or had the outliers removed.  Papers typically only analyze a portion of the 4050 vector too.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">welldata
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of length 4050.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
#### Load the data in the R package changepoint.influence ####
data("welldata")
welllog = welldata[1001:2000] 
# Extract the mid section of the data as analyzed in other papers
n = length(welllog)
var = NULL; for (i in 30:1000){var[i]=var(welllog[(i-29):i])} 
welllogs = welllog/sqrt(median(var, na.rm = TRUE)) 
# rescale the data to have unit variance across time, 
# note that there may still be changes in variance across the series.

#### Apply PELT to the welllog data ####
out.PELT = cpt.mean(welllogs, method = 'PELT')

#### Calculate the influence measures ####
welllogs.inf = influence(out.PELT) 
# the code extracts all the details of the original cpt.mean() function call
# and uses these in the calculation of the influence for the modified data.

#### Stability Dashboards ####
StabilityOverview(welllogs,cpts(out.PELT),welllogs.inf,las=1,ylab='Nuclear-Magnetic Response', 
    legend.args=list(display=TRUE,x="bottomright",y=NULL,cex=1.5,bty="n",horiz=FALSE,xpd=FALSE))
# We can specify where the legend will sit in the graphic via the legend.args 
# which are passed to the legend() function.  We can also include additional 
# arguments to pass to the plotting such as las=1 here.

#### Location Stability plot ####
exp.seg=LocationStability(cpts(out.PELT), welllogs.inf, type = 'Difference', cpt.lwd = 4, las = 1)
# Note that if the expected segmentation is not provided, it will be calcuated 
# and then returned so that the user can avoid calculating this again in other plot calls.

#### Parameter Stability plot ####
ParameterStability(welllogs.inf, original.mean = rep(param.est(out.PELT)$mean, 
  times=diff(c(0,out.PELT@cpts))), las = 1, ylab = 'Nuclear-Magnetic Response')
# Note that the original.mean argument is provided for each timepoint so is a length n vector.

#### Influence Map ####
welllogs.inf = influence(out.PELT, method = "delete")
inf.resid.del=InfluenceMap(cpts(out.PELT), welllogs.inf, data = welllogs, include.data = TRUE, 
  ylab = 'Nuclear-Magnetic\n Response')

welllogs.inf = influence(out.PELT, method = "outlier")
inf.resid.out=InfluenceMap(cpts(out.PELT), welllogs.inf, data = welllogs, include.data = TRUE, 
  ylab='Nuclear-Magnetic\n Response')
