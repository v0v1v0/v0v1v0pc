<h2>Predicted transition probabilities out of every state made at time s = 100</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data frame containing the predicted transition probabilities out of states 1 (transplant),
2 (adverse event), 3 (recovery) and 4 (adverse event + recovery), made at time s = 100.
The predicted transition probabilities were estimated by fitting a multistate model
to the <code>ebmt4</code> data using a leave-one-out approach. Code for deriving
this dataset is provided in the source code for <code>calibmsm</code>. Code for derivation
of this dataset is provided in the source code for the package.

<dt>pstate1, pstate2, pstate3, pstate4, pstate5, pstate6</dt>
<dd>
<p>Predicted transition probabilities of transitions into states 1 to 6</p>
</dd>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>This dataset was derived from data made available within the <code>mstate</code> package, see <code>ebmt4</code>.
The data was originally provided by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (https://www.ebmt.org/).
We reiterate the source statement given by the developers of <code>mstate</code>:
"We acknowledge the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
for making available these data. Disclaimer: these data were simplified for the
purpose of illustration of the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models
and do not reflect any real life situation. No clinical conclusions should be
drawn from these data."
