<h2>Northern Cricket Frog</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an experiment due to Ferguson et al. (1967) a number of northern
cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) were collected from the mud flats of an
abandoned stream meandering near Indianola, Mississippi, and taken to a test pen
lying to the north west of the collection point. After 30 hours of
enclosure within a dark environmental chamber, 14 of them were released and
the directions taken by these frogs recorded. 0 degrees means North.
