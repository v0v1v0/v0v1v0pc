<h2>Generate co-occurrence matrices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The co-occurrence matrices are generated by this function. This function can
be used obtain the co-occurrence matrix for each primary study.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coefa_gcm(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing multiple trimmed factor loading matrices</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional parameters which generate the co-occurrence matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The meta-analysts can use this function to obtain the co-occurrence
matrix for each primary study. And the algorithm is that a trimmed factor
loading matrix multiplies its transpose in the list. As a result, the number
of the dimension of the matrix obtained in this step equates with that of
the items included in a scale. In this new matrix, the values on the
cross-cells indicate the clusters of the items. The greater the value in
the cross-cells of a co-occurrence matrix, the bigger the degree of similarity
between paired items.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing multiple co-occurrence matrices.

#The real co-occurrence matrix should be generated from actual studies.
