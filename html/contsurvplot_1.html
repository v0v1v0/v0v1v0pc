<h2>
Visualize the Effect of a Continuous Variable on a Time-To-Event Outcome
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong><em>What is this package about?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This package provides different plotting routines to visualize the (causal) effect of a continuous variable on a time-to-event outcome using a previously fit model and g-computation. Unlike simpler alternatives, such as plotting survival curves for some categories, these plots always correspond to the results obtained by the time-to-event model and give an accurate depiction of the causal effect, if all assumptions are met.
</p>
<p><strong><em>What features are included in this package?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The package includes 11 different plot functions, most based on the <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> package. Those 11 plotting routines include <em>value specific survival curves</em>, <em>landmark survival probability plots</em>, <em>survival time quantile plots</em>, <em>survival probability heatmaps</em>, and <em>survival area plots</em>, among others. A description and comparison of these plots can be found in the article associated with this R-package (Denz &amp; Timmesfeld 2022).
</p>
<p><strong><em>What does a typical workflow using this package look like?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>All the user has to do is fit a time-to-event model, such as the cox-model, including the continuous variable of interest (and possibly confounders) and plug it into one of the plot functions included in this package. Many different kind of models are supported. See <code>curve_cont</code> for more details.
</p>
<p><strong><em>What type of plot should I use?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>There is no general answer to this question, but we would usually suggest using a plot method that is able to visualize the causal survival probability both as a function of time and as a function of the continuous variable. The <code>plot_surv_area</code>, <code>plot_surv_heatmap</code> and <code>plot_surv_contour</code> functions do just that. More discussion about this topic can be found in the vignette and the associated paper.
</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the difference between displaying causal effects and associations?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The plots generated by this package offer different ways to depict the association between a continuous variable and a time-to-event outcome. Under certain causal identifiability assumptions, which are described in detail in our article on this topic (see references), this association can be endowed with a causal interpretation. Under these assumptions, the estimates can be interpreted as the survival probability that would have been observed if all individuals in the target population had received a specific level of the continuous variable. If these assumptions are not met, this interpretation is invalid.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Where can I get more information?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The documentation pages contain a lot of information, relevant examples and literature references. Additional examples can be found in the vignette of this package, which can be accessed using <code>vignette(topic="introduction", package="contsurvplot")</code>. We also published a preprint of the article about this package on arXiv (see references), which contains an in-depth discussion about the plots and how to interpret them.
